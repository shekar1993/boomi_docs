Whereas comments are submitted on blogs and documentation pages, posts are submitted on forum topics. You can moderate the forum topics and posts that are visible to all users. All registered users can submit posts for the published topics on the Portal. The **Posts** sub-tab lists all posts submitted by the users sorted by date and time. By using the links on the **Posts** sub-tab, you can edit posts and view user activities related to posts on the Portal.

The following table describes the fields on the Posts tab.
