A support user is a Control Center role that gives read-only access to all pages in the API Control Center dashboard. Buttons (such as **Save, Create, Edit,** and **Delete**) and various fields (such as checkboxes and text boxes) are disabled for support users. 

:::note

Legacy pages are not shown to support users.

## Procedure

To add a Support User:

1. Log into API Control Center with a user that has Admin rights to create users. 

2. Go to the Manage > Users tab. 

3. For a new user, create a **New User** with the necessary fields, then click **Create**, which opens the **User Access Settings** page. 

4. In the **Control Center Roles** section, select **Area Level** for **the Organization**, and **Support User** as the **Control Center Role**.
