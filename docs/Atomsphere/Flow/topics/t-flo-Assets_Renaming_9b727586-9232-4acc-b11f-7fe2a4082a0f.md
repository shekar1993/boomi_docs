You can rename assets on the **Assets** page.

To rename an asset:

1.  Navigate to the **Assets** page.
2.  Click on the asset row for the asset you wish to rename.
3.  Click the **Rename** link shown above the assets library.
4.  The asset **File** field becomes editable. Rename the asset as required and press **Enter** to save the change.
5.  The asset is renamed and updated in the asset library.

:::note

When you rename an asset, the url for the asset will change accordingly, and any hard-coded links to the asset using this url from within your flows will need to be updated to reflect the modified url.
