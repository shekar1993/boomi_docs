Removing a field from a field group is a drag-and-drop operation.

## About this task

To delete a field group without deleting all of its fields, first individually remove from the field group each field you want to keep as described below.

## Procedure

1.  In the **Fields** tab, expand the field group.

2.  Drag the reorder icon ![](../Images/Common/main-ic-dots-16-gray-on-white_404b1c3f-e21a-4b67-ba76-65412d39eb70.jpg) for the field you want to remove.

    As you drag, a dashed horizontal line dynamically shows the position into which the field would be moved if you were to drop the icon at the pointer location.
