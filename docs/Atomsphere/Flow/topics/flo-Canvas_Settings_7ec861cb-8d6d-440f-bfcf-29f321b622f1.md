-   Canvas Settings are applied at a User level. Any changes you make are applied to the flow canvas across all your tenants and flows.

-   **Element Style**: Change the general element canvas settings:

    -   **Color Borders**: Canvas elements are shown with an outline and no fill \(default\).

    -   **Color Fill**: Canvas elements are shown with a color fill applied.

    -   **Color Fill When Zoomed Out**: Canvas elements are shown with an outline and no fill at a higher zoom, with canvas elements then being shown with a color fill applied once you zoom out beyond a certain point. This setting helps to provide greater visual clarity of elements when the canvas is zoomed out.

-   **Element border thickness**: Increase/decrease the border width of canvas elements.
