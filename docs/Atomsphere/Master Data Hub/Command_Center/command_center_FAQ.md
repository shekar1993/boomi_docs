## Do you need a ServiceNow license to use the Command Center?

No, because the ServiceNow application layer is included in the Boomi runtime time environment for DataHub.

## Can existing Boomi customers utilize the Command Center?

Yes, in the initial controlled release (January 2025) via [Limited Availability](/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/atm-Feature_release_stages_00d83b66-e5db-4038-8398-fcaead4be12d.md). While we are limiting the number of customers, the release will be open to both existing and new DataHub customers up to that specified limit. <br/><br/>
The foundational read-only view will be rolled out more broadly to existing Hub customers throughout 2025 based on platform readiness and performance validation.


## Is the Command Center available globally?

Initial access is focused on US customers to ensure optimal performance. While the infrastructure (including ServiceNow and Boomi platform) is US-hosted, non-US customers should review data sovereignty requirements related to this architecture.
