This connector is now in Deprecated status. It is no longer available for new users and is not actively maintained. We will provide a minimum six-month notice before its retirement. We recommend upgrading to the newer supported version of this connector.

This tutorial shows how you can configure the SAML (Deprecated) connector for SSO using Auth0 authentication.

## About this tutorial

In this tutorial, we are going to install the SAML (Deprecated) connector and connect it to an Auth0 IdP.

**What you will learn**: This tutorial is designed for advanced users, and aims to introduce the example steps involved in configuring the to use Auth0 authentication.

## Step 1: Creating and configuring an Auth0 web application

1.  Create a new application in [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) and enter a suitable name for the application.
2.  Select the **Regular Web Applications** application type.
3.  Click **Create** to create the application.
4.  Configure the application as follows:
    -   **Settings**
        -   **Token Endpoint Authentication Method**: Set this to **Basic**

        -   **Allowed Callback URLs**: Enter 

    -   **Advanced Settings**
        -   Download the certificate
    -   **Add-ons**
        -   Enable the **SAML2 Web App** Add-on and change the following setting:

        -   **Settings \| Application Callback URL**: Enter 

        -   **Usage****\| Identity Provider Login URL**: Copy this value and save for use in Step 2.

        -   Once you have made these changes, save and enable the Add-on.

    -   **Connections:**
        -   Select the connection that you want to use, for example **Database \| Username-Password-Authentication**.

5.  Save your changes to complete your Auth0 application configuration.

## Step 2: Installing the SAML Auth0 connector in

1.  Install a for use with Auth0. See [Installing the SAML (Deprecated) connector](c-flo-SAML_Installation_0c7580d2-e07f-45d2-b81c-91778ec4c19f.md) for guidance. During installation, use the following values:
    -   **Login URL**: Paste the "User access URL" \(you have the **Identity Provider Login URL** value already saved from the previous step\). For example, `https://your\_user.eu.auth0.comsamlp/diIaEInPnP37Sf123456`.

    -   **Certificate**: Create an Encrypted value but leave it empty for now.

    -   **Assertion Consumer Service \(URL\)**: Enter `https://flow.manywho.com/api/run/1/saml`

    -   **Identifier of the IdP entity \(URI\)**: Enter the IdP **Issuer** value from your SAML web app.

    -   **Identifier of the SP entity \(URI\)**: Enter `http://localhost`

    -   **No XML Validation**: Set to **False**

    -   **Debug**: Set to **False** \(can be set to **True** if debug is needed, but it should be always **False** at production\)

    -   **Supported Users**: Leave this field empty.

    -   **Supported Groups**: Leave this field empty.

2.  Save the connector.

## Step 3: Configuring the SAML Auth0 service in

1.  Select **API** from the main left-hand menu to open the API tool.
2.  Enter `api/draw/1/element/service?filter=` into the API **Address** field.
3.  Click **GET**.
4.  The **Response** pane now contains the id for the SAML . Copy this value.
5.  Enter `api/draw/1/element/service/\{id\}` into the API **Address** field, replacing \{id\} with the copied ID.
6.  Click **GET**.
7.  Copy all the information in the **Response** pane and paste it into the **Request** pane.
8.  In the **Request** pane, change *sendDecryptedValues* to `True`.
9.  Enter `api/draw/1/element/service` into the API **Address** field.
10. Click **Post**.
11. You can now protect a flow using Auth0 with a SAML app.
