You can create a scheduled maintenance event and apply it to the desired endpoints. This will result in API calls not directing to the selected endpoints during the maintenance time. 

## Prcodedure 

To create a scheduled maintenance event:

1. On the Scheduled Maintenance Events page, click **New Scheduled Maintenance Event**. 

   The **New Scheduled Maintenance Event** pop-up window is displayed. 

2. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the maintenance event. 

3. Select a **Start Time** and an **End Time**.

4. Click **Save and close**. 

   You can add endpoints to the maintenance event. For more information, refer to [Managing Endpoints](Managingendpoints/Managing_endpoints.md).
