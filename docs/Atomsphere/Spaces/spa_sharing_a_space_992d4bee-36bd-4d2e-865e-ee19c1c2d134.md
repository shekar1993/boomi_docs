Creating a Space in the Admin Space creates a unique URL for Spaces. You can share this URL with your intended users to give them access to the Space. Users can sign into the Spaces Page via this URL and install, configure, and manage shared integrations.

To share the Space URL:

1. On the **Spaces** page, click on the name of your Space. 

    The **Space Information** page opens.

2. Click **Copy** next to the **Space URL** box to copy it. Paste the URL to a new tab to open the Spaces (User Space) Home screen.

3. Additionally, you can click the **Launch Space** button, to navigate to a new tab and launch the current Space directly.

4. Paste the URL to a new tab to open the Spaces (User Space) Home screen.
