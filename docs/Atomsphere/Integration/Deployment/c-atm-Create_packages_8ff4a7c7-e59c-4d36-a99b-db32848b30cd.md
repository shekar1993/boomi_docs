Creating packages is the first step in deploying components in the . You can package components from the **Build** page or the **Package Manager** page \(**Deploy** \> **Package Manager**\).

Processes and components must be packaged before they can be deployed or shared, either in the Process Library or as part of an integration pack. You package individual components. However, a package can consist of a primary component and all the dependent components that are required to support that component. For processes, API Service components, and Processing Group components, a package might include connectors, maps, or process properties. For other deployable components (such as certificates or custom libraries), a package is the component itself.

You can create a package from:

- the Build page, while the component is open and saved

- the Package Manager page, while viewing a list of deployable components
