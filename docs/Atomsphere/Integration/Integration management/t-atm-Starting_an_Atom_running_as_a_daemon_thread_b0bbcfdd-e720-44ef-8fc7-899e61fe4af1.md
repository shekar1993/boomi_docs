You can start Atoms, Molecule nodes, and Cloud Molecules.


## Procedure

1.  Open a console window.

2.  Go to `<installation_directory>\bin` and execute the `atom start` command.

  This starts the Atom, Molecule node, or Cloud Molecule if it is not running. If the Atom, Molecule node, or Cloud Molecule is already running, then this command does nothing.



## Results

To confirm that your Atom, Molecule node, or Cloud Molecule is running as a daemon thread, you can execute the `atom status` command.
