Use complex page conditions to apply advanced conditional formatting and behaviour to components in a page layout.

## Overview

Complex page conditions allow you to build and apply more complex If-Then conditional formatting and behavior to components on a page, than if you were to use the [Basic page conditions](flo-Conditions_basic_cfbe2a47-b326-4de9-9675-2092f11d47a2.md) interface.

## Creating a complex page condition

To create a complex page condition, you will manually build the IF-THEN conditional logic of the page condition, using Page Rules and Page Operations.

    -   [Page Rules](flo-Conditions_rules_c2625ff4-12fa-40da-b277-b48e9530eb86.md): Define the condition\(s\) that must be met for a page operation to be performed on a page component.

    -   [Page Operations](flo-Conditions_operations_6bca370d-9dd9-401e-822c-956bfe78c977.md): Define what operation\(s\) are performed on a page component when the page rule condition is met.
