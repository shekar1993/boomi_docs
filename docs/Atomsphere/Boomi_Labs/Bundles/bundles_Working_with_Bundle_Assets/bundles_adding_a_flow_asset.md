Flows are assets you can add to Bundles and share with others to automate simple and sophisticated workflows. 

To add a Flow asset to the Bundle:

1. Click on the Bundle name link to go inside the Bundle.
2. In the **Assets** tab, click **Add Asset**.
3. In the **Add Asset to Bundle** pop-up, select **Flow** from the **Select Asset Type** drop-down.

:::note

While adding Flow assets to a Bundle, you must ensure that your Flow account uses the same email address as the AtomSphere Platform account that  you are using to create the Bundle. Otherwise, you will receive the following message:<br/>
`Unable to connect to flow. Please ensure your credentials are valid for an active Flow account.`

:::

4. Select a **Flow Tenant** from the **Select Flow Tenant** dropdown. Note that expired tenants will not be visible.
5. Select a **Flow** from the Select Flow dropdown.
6. In the **Asset Name** field, type the asset name.
7. **Asset Description** (Optional): Type a description for the asset in the Asset Description field, then click **Next**.
8. Review the details of the Flow asset, and then click **Add to Bundle** to finish adding it.

:::note

 In case you are trying to add a Flow asset that has never been Run or Published, you will see the following error: <br/> 
 `No Flow snapshot could be found for Flow`.<br/>  If this happens, you need to Run or Publish the Flow before adding it to your Bundle.  This limitation will be fixed in a future release.
