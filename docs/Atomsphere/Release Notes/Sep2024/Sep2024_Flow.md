**We added this feature:**

**OpenAI Connector & AI Chat Component**: You can now connect to OpenAI and integrate a chat box to generate responses in your Flow applications. Responses will stream in real-time, similar to ChatGPT for example, enhancing the user experience. This is a significant feature enabling seamless AI integration.
