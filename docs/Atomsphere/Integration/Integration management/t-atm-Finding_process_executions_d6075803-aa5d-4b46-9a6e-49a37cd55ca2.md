Use Process Reporting to find process executions.

## Procedure

1.  Go to **Manage** \> **Process Reporting** and select **Executions** from the list on the left.

2.  Click the arrow next to the time/date filter and select one of the following from the dialog:

    -   **Past Hour**

    -   **Past 24 Hours**

    -   **Past Week**

    -   **Date Range**. Select **From** and **To** dates from the calendars. You can optionally select an hour and minutes for each date.

3.  Click **Apply**.

    The execution search results appear in the table.

4. **Optional:** To filter the results by Atom, click **Add Filter** and choose the **Atom** filter type.

    1.  Select one to 10 Atoms.

    2.  Click **Apply**.

    If you want to see results for all Atoms, do not set this filter. If you select more than 10 Atoms, you will see an error message.

5. **Optional:** To filter the results by process, click **Add Filter** and choose the **Process** filter type.

    1.  Type part or all of a process name, or the entire process ID in the Filter Processes field.

    2.  Select one to 10 processes.

    3.  Click **Apply**.

    If you want to see results for all processes, do not set this filter. If you select more than 10 processes, you will see an error message.

6. **Optional:** To filter the results by execution ID, click **Add Filter** and choose the **Execution ID** filter type.

    If another filter is selected first \(after the time/date range filter\), you cannot add the Execution ID filter to your search criteria. Skip to the next step.

    1.  Type the execution ID.

    2.  Click **Apply**.

    If the Execution ID filter is selected first \(after the time/date range filter\), you cannot add more filters to your search criteria. Skip to step 11.

7. **Optional:** To filter the results by the presence of inbound documents, click **Add Filter** and choose the **Hide Successes with 0 Inbound Docs** filter type.

8. **Optional:** To filter the results by the execution type, click **Add Filter** and choose the **Execution Modes** filter type.

    1.  Select one or more execution types.

    2.   Click **Apply**.

9. **Optional:** To clear the selected filter, click its gray Clear icon, or to clear all filters, click **![Red circle with white X](../Images/main-ic-x-white-in-red-circle-in-box-28x31_42b3d3dc-56b6-4549-a3c3-39b7e6f4fd0d.jpg) Clear All Filters**.

10. **Optional:** To further filter the results, click one of the following:

    -   **All** \(the default\)

    -   **Errors**

    -   **Pending**

    -   **Successes**

11. **Optional:** To see details about an execution and the documents processed during it, click the execution’s date/time link in the results table.

    The execution detail view opens.

12. **Optional:** To view a list of documents processed during the execution, by connection, and optionally rerun the documents or view their data, click a connection or the **Successes** or **Errors** count for that connection.

13. **Optional:** To view and optionally troubleshoot process or document error details, click the error message link in the execution detail view.

    The Error Detail view opens.
