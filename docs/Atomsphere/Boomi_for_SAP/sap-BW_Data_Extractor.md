The BW Data Extractor simplifies the extraction of data from SAP for BW reporting, facilitating the processing of BW Extractors through REST services. 

It integrates with SAPâ€™s standard BW Extractor feature and exposes the Extractors for a seamless integration, enabling the use of this data in Boomi processes.

With this feature, Boomi for SAP Core can be configured to send metadata of BW Extractors to a REST service and can expose REST services that allow retrieving and deleting BW Extractors. 

This means that organizations can leverage the BW Extractor to aggregate financial data and send it to a reporting database or send changed order data to a data warehouse.
