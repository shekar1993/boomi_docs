The Slack connector simplified the integration with Slack, the cloud-based collaboration tool, to help improve collaboration in your organization.

## Connector configuration 

To configure a connector to communicate with Slack, set up these two components:

-   Slack connection

-   Slack operation


## Prerequisites 

To implement a connection to Slack from Boomi Integration, do the following:

-   Create a new Slack application at [https://api.slack.com/apps/](https://api.slack.com/apps/). Be sure to select the Boomi workspace to create your Slack app.

-   Get your Slack client ID and client secret.

-   Make sure an Atom is deployed on your local machine or hosted with Boomi Integration.


## Tracked properties 

There are no tracked properties in the Slack connector.
