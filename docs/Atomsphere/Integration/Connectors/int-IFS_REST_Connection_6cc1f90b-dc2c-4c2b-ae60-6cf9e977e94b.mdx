The IFS REST – Partner connection represents and contains all the information that is needed to connect and log into a single IFS account that is associated with your workspace.

If you have multiple accounts, you need a separate connection for each. You can pair a single connection with different operations to perform a unique action against an instance of IFS.

## Connection tab

The IFS REST – Partner connector supports Basic Authentication \(username:encodedpassword\).

**URL**: \(Required\) The home URL of your IFS Application endpoint. For example: https://server-name.ifsworld.com

**Ports**: Depending on the IFS Application setup you may also need to include the port within the URL. For example:`https://server-name.ifsworld.com:48080` \(in this example, replace 48080 with your port number\)

**Authentication Type**: The authentication type used by the service:

  -   **Basic** – provide a user name and password.

**Username**: The IFS Application username associated to the account to be used to authenticate.

**Password**: The IFS Application password associated to the account to be used to authenticate.
