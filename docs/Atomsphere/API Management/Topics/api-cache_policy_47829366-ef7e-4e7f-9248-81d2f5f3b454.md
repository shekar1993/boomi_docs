The cache policy enables you to cache the upstream response (content, status, and headers) and avoid subsequent calls to the backend.

This policy is based on a cache resource defined at the API level and allows the underlying cache system to follow the API lifecycle (stop / start). Cache resource is created automatically when you attach the cache policy rule to an API.

You can bypass cache by adding a `cache=BY_PASS` query parameter or by providing an `X-Gravitee-Cache=BY_PASS` HTTP header.

:::note
If you have a multi-node Gateway cluster, the API request will be cached for each node because the cache is JVM-centric.

## Configuration


| Property  |Required   |Description   | Type  | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  `cacheName` |  yes |The cache resource used to store the element.   |string |
|  `key` |  no | The key used to store the element (supports [EL](docs/Atomsphere/API%20Management/Topics/api-expression_language.md)).  |string |
|  `timeToLiveSeconds` | yes  | Time to live of the element in cache.  | integer| 600 (10 minutes) |
|`methods`| no| The method to cache.|array of strings| [GET,OPTIONS,HEAD]
|`responseCondition`|no|Add an extra condition (with Expression Language) based on the response to activate cache. For example, use `{#upstreamResponse.status == 200}` to only cache 200 responses status. If a `responseCondition` is not specified, all 2xx responses are cached by default.|string||
| `useResponseCacheHeaders` |no | Time to live based on 'Cache-Control' and/or 'Expires' headers from backend response. | boolean | false|
| `scope` | yes|Cached response can be set for a single consumer (application) or for all applications. **Caution** If you use an ` \"API\" ` scope, data will be shared between all consumers. | API/APPLICATION | APPLICATION |

## Examples

Key based on the `productId` query parameter:
```
"key": "{#request.params['productId']}"
```

Key based on the api-key of the consumer:
```
"key": "{#request.headers['X-Gravitee-Api-Key']}"
```
Key based on an APIâ€™s property and a query parameter:
```
"key": "{#properties['siteID']}-{#request.params['productId']}"
```
Configuration example:
``` json
"cache": {
    "cacheName": "policy-cache",
    "key": "{#request.params['productId']}",
    "timeToLiveSeconds": 600,
    "useResponseCacheHeaders": false,
    "scope": "APPLICATION",
    "methods": ["POST"],
    "responseCondition": "{#upstreamResponse.status == 201}"
}
```
