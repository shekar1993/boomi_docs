## Changelog

**2024-07 (Version 33, Current)**

- New operation: LISTEN

  - It allows the connector to browse WebSocket EDA subscriptions, build response profiles, and connect to corresponding WebSocket servers identified through browse. It supports JSON and XML schemas.
  
  - Once connected, the connector listens to any message sent to the subscriptionâ€™s receiver. It then processes this message and submits the result to downstream processes. If the connection fails, one error is submitted, and an indefinite retry loop is started.

:::info Important

SAP will send events to the WebSocket server regardless of listening connectors; the event may be lost if no connector is listening.

**2024-02 (Version 32)**

- ABAP_PROXY_SEND function is modified to import request and response profile using Import wizard.

**2023-09 (Version 29)**

- A new `PROXY_SEND` operation utilizes SAP ABAP Proxies and timeout when the connection is slow or unresponsive.
