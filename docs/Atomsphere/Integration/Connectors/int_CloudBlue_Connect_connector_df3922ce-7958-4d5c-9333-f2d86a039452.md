The CloudBlue Connect platform enables the users to work in real-time with the transactions generated between distributors, resellers, and customers.

The CloudBlue Connect - Partner connector enables vendors and distributors to seamlessly integrate their contract, listing, fulfillment, and usage processes into their internal or line-of-business systems without coding.

## Benefits 

By integrating CloudBlue Connect with your platform, you will drastically reduce the time for various marketing operations and simultaneously eliminate any possible errors. The CloudBlue Connect enables users to address the automation for your business and collaborations with your business partners. Thus, increasing both the productivity and reliability of your organization.

Alongside the business purposes, integration with the Connect platform provides your organization with an upper hand in decision-making. The CloudBlue Connect can be used to create alerts or notifications as well as to generate various reports and product usage files.

Another reason to integrate Connect with your platform is a messaging system. For each transaction, Connect generates a request and provides the conversation box. Vendors, Resellers, and Distributors can post a message in that conversation box and consequently generate a transaction history. Furthermore, the Connect platform provides a comprehensive Helpdesk ticketing system that allows your business and technical support to be organized and efficient.

When the process is defined properly, Integration can map to and from virtually any system using the CloudBlue Connect - Partner connector to upload, store, retrieve, and delete data from CloudBlue Connect in order to manage your business workflows.
