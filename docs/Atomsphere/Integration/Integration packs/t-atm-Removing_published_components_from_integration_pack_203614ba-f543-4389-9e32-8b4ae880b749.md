From the **Integration Packs** page, remove published components from an integration pack to ensure the component is not included in a new release of the integration pack.

## Procedure

1.  In the Integration Packs page, select the integration pack.

2.  In the Publications list, select the component that you want to remove and click **![](../Images/main-ic-x-white-in-red-circle-16_0d0c5dc5-1c5e-4117-8a58-92c5e050ec5b.jpg) Remove**.

    A confirmation dialog opens.

3.  Click **OK**.

    The component remains in the Publications list, but “deleted” appears in the **Pending Version** column to indicate the component will not be included in a new release.
