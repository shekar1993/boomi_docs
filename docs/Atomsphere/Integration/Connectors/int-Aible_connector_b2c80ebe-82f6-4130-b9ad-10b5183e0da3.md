Aible is the pioneer in ROI-optimized AI that systematically delivers business impact while respecting your business constraints.

Aible is built from the ground up to deliver business impact by helping you predict, optimize, and anticipate change. The result: sustained ROI. Fast.

The Aible AI – Partner connector lets you enrich any source data with dynamic, optimized predictions tuned to your up-to-the-minute strategy and business objectives.



## Connector configuration 

To configure the connector to communicate with Aible, set up the following components:


-   Aible AI – Partner connection
-   Aible AI – Partner operation

This design provides reusable components which contain connection settings and operation settings. After building your connection and operation, set up your connector within a process. When the process is defined properly, Boomi Integration can map to and from virtually any system using the Aible AI – Partner connector to enrich data with AI predictions.

## Supported editions 

The Aible AI – Partner connector works with any edition of Aible through the Aible CSV scoring REST API.

## Prerequisites 

To implement a connection to your Aible project from Boomi Integration:

-   Have your login and password to access Aible
-   Uploading data:
    -   Know which tenant to use \(if you have access to more than one\)
    -   Know which cloud account to store the data \(if more than one is configured\)

-   Scoring data:
    -   Know your Aible project ID and tenant
