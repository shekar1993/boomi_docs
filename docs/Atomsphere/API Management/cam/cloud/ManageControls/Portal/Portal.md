Your API Management powered Portal is the primary interface between your API program and your developers. It is the application that they use to learn about your APIs, to get keys, and to view reports. The Portal is a highly configurable and customizable application and Portal Settings is the primary tool used to setup these customizations, thereby giving you tremendous control over the developer experience. 

The **Portal Settings** tab can be used to customize the look and feel of the Portal and Portal functionality, to set the notification alerts and emails, to enable or disable content features such as search, blog, documentation, forum, and Interactive Documentation. Each sub-tab within Portal settings serves an important purpose in helping the administrator to control the experience. 

The following user roles can access the **Portal Settings** tab: 

- Administrator 

- Portal Manager 

The Portal Settings tab contains the following sub-tabs: 

- [General](General_portal.md) - Allows setting the Portal name. This tab contains links to other sub-tabs under **Portal Setup**.

- [Portal Setup](Portalsetup/Portal_setup.md) - Allows setting the Portal settings such as Logo, JavaScript (custom and inline), CSS (custom and inline), primary navigation links, and Footer (links and copyright).

- [Domain Names](Domainnames/Domain_names.md) - Allows adding domains, setting the primary domain and redirects, access restrictions for the Portal using HTTP Authentication and IP restrictions.
