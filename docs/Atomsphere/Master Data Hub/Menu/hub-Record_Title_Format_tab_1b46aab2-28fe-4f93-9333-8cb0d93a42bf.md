The **Record Title Format** tab in the model page is used to set the golden record title format.

Golden record titles are visible in pages accessed through the Stewardship menu in data grids, quarantine entry lists, and staged entities lists, and as view headings in detail views for golden records, quarantine entries, and staged entities. Title format field values in referenced golden records also appear in the Golden Records and Quarantine pages as reference field values for resolved references. You cannot add masked field to the golden record title format.

Select Fields  
A maximum of three fields are selectable for inclusion in the title format. Neither reference fields nor collection fields are selectable.

Typing in the search field above the list filters the list to include only fields and field groups whose names partially or completely match the typed characters.

**Record Title Format**  
Sets the title format.

Fields selected in the field list are included in the format and are represented by their unique ID. Insertion of static text is allowed.

If **Tag View On** is selected, the order of the selected fields can be changed by dragging and dropping their tags, and fields can be removed from the format by clicking ![](../Images/Common/main-ic-x-white-in-gray-circle-16_0abafeee-d5e7-4888-9bfb-475b11b6d00f.jpg).

Removing a field automatically deselects it in the field list.

**Tag View Off/On**  
  -   If **Tag View Off** is selected \(the default\), fields selected in the field list are represented in **Record Title Format** as bracketed text.

-   If **Tag View On** is selected, fields selected in the field list are represented by tags.
