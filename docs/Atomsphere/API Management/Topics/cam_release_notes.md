This release focuses on branding, iconography, and fonts in adherence with standards per Boomi service offerings. All major design workflows and user experience remain largely unchanged. This will not have any impact on runtime. We urge you to review your custom Developer Portals and replace all TIBCO branding and references with Boomi Cloud API Management. If you need more information or assistance, contact Boomi Support by opening a case.
