## Overview

components are reusable, customizable elements that you can add to a page to provide common web interface features and functionality.

For example:

-   Add presentation components to present rich-text and multimedia content.

-   Add table components to present data as interactive tables, using data from connectors and data sources.

-   Add input components to enable user input functionality, and allow users to interact with a page.


## Standard components

Flow comes with a set of standard pre-built components.

You can add standard components from the page builder **Components** menu.

-   [Content components](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/flo-pages-components-content_186a3e9e-0c24-4570-a341-32aff7f4d76b.md): Display content on a page, such as rich text, images and multimedia.

-   [Input components](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/flo-pages-components-input_e6b419b2-403d-409a-bcf3-77ed9f522fdb.md): Add form functionality such as input fields, radio buttons, and checkboxes into a page, to allow user input in a flow.

-   [Data components](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/flo-pages-components-data_9d62c740-1181-4e91-86f8-1e8dbb46022b.md): Display interactive data on a page, and allow your flow users to interact with files.


## Custom components

If you require a user interface feature not provided by the standard components, you can build a custom component instead, and add it to a page just like a standard component.

You can add custom components from the **Custom** section of the page builder **Components** menu. This section is not shown if there are no custom components installed in the tenant. See [Components](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/flo-custom-components_39b7f35b-5156-4f7d-98c0-400330f2d34e.md).
