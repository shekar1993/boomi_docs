Search and filter options enable you to quickly find packaged components to deploy.

From the **Deploy** \> **Deployments** page, you can filter the list of deployments by:

- **Date** — Filter and narrow results by deployments that were initiated within the past hour, the past 24 hours, the past week, or within a specified date range.

- **Component** — Filter by the specific names of deployed components.

- **Component Type** — Filter by a specific type of component category. For example, process or API service.

- **Deployed By** — Enter a user email to see only those deployments that were initiated by a specific user.

- **Deployment ID** — Filter by the unique identifier associated with a specific deployment. You can view the Deployment ID by click on a deployment's **Action** menu ![img-int-black_gear](../Images/main-ic-gear-black-16_cdde83e4-a176-436a-86ca-1fe4937e3085.jpg), and select **Deployment History** from the list of options. The alphanumeric identifier is located in the Deployment ID column.

    :::note
    
    In order to see Deployment ID in the list of filter options, you must first clear any default filters that are automatically applied to the Deployments page.

    :::

- **Environment** — Filter results to show only those components that were deployed to the selected environment.

- **Packaged Version** — Filters versions of packaged components according to any matches that exist in the Packaged Version column.

- **Packaged Component ID** - Filters packaged components according to a specific ID. You can locate and copy a packaged component's ID by going to the **Action menu ![Action menu icon](../Images/main-ic-gear-black-16_cdde83e4-a176-436a-86ca-1fe4937e3085.jpg)** \> **Package Component Details page**.

When you deploy packaged components from the Deployments page, the Select Packaged Components step of the Deployment wizard displays all available packaged components in the current account in alphabetical order that are eligible for deployment. If some packaged components are stored in folders, the folders appear alphabetically as well. At the top of the list there is a filter icon and a search box that you can use to search for packaged components to deploy by name, or filter by Component Name or Component ID.
