Apply pending updates to Atoms and connectors on the **Atom & Connector Versions** panel.

## Before you begin

You must have the Atom Management privilege to perform this task. If you have the Atom Management Read Access privilege, you cannot perform the task.

## Procedure

1.  Go to **Manage** \> **Atom Management**.

2.  Select the Atom, Molecule, or Cloud from the Environments list on the left.

3.  Click the **Atom & Connector Versions** panel.

    If a newer version of the Atom \(or Molecule or Cloud\) or a connector is available, the version numbers appear in the **Pending Version** column. If you are authorized to apply the pending updates, you see the **Select Pending Versions** button at the bottom of the list.

4.  Click **Select Pending Versions**.

    The Select Pending Versions dialog opens.

5.  Select the Atom and connectors you want to update to the versions in the **Pending Version** column.

6.  Click **Apply Selected Updates**.

    A confirmation dialog appears.

7.  Click **OK**.

    You are returned to the Atom & Connector Versions panel with a success message. Your selected Atom and connectors will be updated shortly. The amount of time that it takes vary based on the activity on the Atom, and your Atom may restart during this process. It will wait for a period of inactivity before applying the updates unless you have enabled a "Force Restart Time" on your Atom. The table is updated with the latest version numbers and dates after a page refresh. The **Select Pending Versions** button will disappear when any or all updates are applied, regardless of when the Atom takes the updates. Refresh the page to return the buttons \(if updates are still available\).
