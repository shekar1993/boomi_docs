**We added these features:**

- A new developer documentation site is coming in July, designed for Boomi Developers. It focuses on content and resources for Developer tasks. At launch, expect to see curated content about:

  * Building, publishing, and testing Integration connectors
  * API references for connector deployment and management
  * Code samples
  * SDK changelog
  * Video tutorials 
  * And many more helpful resources

Later this month, you'll see a notification on the help site directing you to this new experience.

- Added the ability to consent for cookies on the Boomi Enterprise Platform login page, boomi.com, and discover.boomi.com. A banner displays, allowing you to accept all cookies or open a cookie preference dialog, where you can select which cookies you want to accept. (UU-6416)

- If you have Admin & Partner privileges in the Boomi Enterprise Platform, you can select **Submissions** from the **Labs** drop-down options. (UU-5581)

- You can no longer revert to the legacy user interface for the Boomi Enterprise Platform. If you were using the legacy UI before this release, a banner displays, linking you to the community article [A New Integration Build Experience](https://community.boomi.com/s/article/A-New-Integration-Build-Experience) for more information. (UU-3006)

- The Java Corretto version for Boomi Enterprise Platform services was upgraded to version 8u412c. (PS-4752)
