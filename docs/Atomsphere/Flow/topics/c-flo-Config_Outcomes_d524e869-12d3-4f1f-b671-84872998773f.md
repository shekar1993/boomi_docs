Outcomes are usually added on the flow canvas, but you can also add an outcome for a map element directly from the configuration panel, or manage outcomes already applied to the map element.

For more information on using outcomes see [Outcomes](c-flo-Outcomes_4049ee93-d7e4-4bc0-ba33-88e523bf4d89.md) and [Joining map elements with outcomes on the flow canvas](c-flo-Canvas_Joining_Elements_dfc06eea-8adf-4baa-a35e-4e8a3d3b1e75.md).

## Adding an outcome to a map element 

1.  Open the configuration panel for the map element you wish to add an outcome to. See [Editing map elements on the flow canvas](c-flo-Canvas_Editing_Elements_656a364c-879f-4153-8ee5-b19e47dca8f5.md). Any existing outcomes for the map element are shown and can be edited or deleted as required.
2.  Click **Add Outcome** to add a new outcome.
3.  The **Outcome** form is displayed. Define the outcome options. See [Outcomes](c-flo-Outcomes_4049ee93-d7e4-4bc0-ba33-88e523bf4d89.md).
4.  Click **Add** to save the new outcome and return to the configuration panel. The new outcome is shown in the **Outcomes** section.
5.  Save your changes to add the outcome to the selected map element.
