Your local Atoms, Molecules, and Atom Cloud need to be in contact with Boomi for tracking and status information.

In many situations, no network or firewall configurations are necessary for an Atom, Molecule, or Atom Cloud to communicate with Boomi. However, if your network policy blocks all outbound or inbound traffic, you need to configure the network to allow Atoms, Molecules, and Atom Clouds to:

- Install locally

- Communicate with the Boomi Enterprise Platform and with any other external web services. See [Host names and IP addresses for the Boomi Enterprise Platform](r-boo-Hostnames_and_IP_addresses_for_platform_a5f68e32-b852-4e36-bdee-80423232a17a.md).

- Make web service calls to the Atom Clouds and Hub Clouds. See [ Hostnames and IP addresses for the Boomi Atom Clouds and Hub Clouds](r-boo-Hostnames_and_IP_addresses_for_Atom_Clouds__0d150522-9457-4c37-b5a9-a8ad664490bd.md).
