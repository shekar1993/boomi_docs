The Subscriptions page facilitates the review and administration of API subscriptions associated with registered applications.

Clicking on an application name expands the view to reveal its subscriptions. You can select a subscription status to provide an associated view of the subscriptions filtered by that status. Deleted subscriptions appear only when theÂ **Deleted** filter is selected.

To delete a subscription, click on the Delete icon.

## Subscription details 

Clicking on the API name of an individual subscription provides you with its associated details.

This interface provides insight into what governance is tied to this subscription as well as its associated API Key. The API Key is used as part of the invocation of calls to this API to provide lineage to the consuming application, ensure governance of the subscription is properly enforced, and facilitate the capturing of usage metrics.
