If there are changes to the structure of documents cached in an integration, you may need to edit indexes or keys in the document cache component.

## Procedure

1.  Open the document cache component.

2.  Pause on the name of an index and click **Edit**.

3.  Edit the name of the index and click **OK**.

    If you delete the index name, it appears as “Unnamed”. All previously saved blank index names also appear as “Unnamed”.

4.  Pause on the name of a key and click **Edit**.

5.  Do one or more of the following:

    -   Edit the name of the key and then click **OK**.

    -   Click the **Browse** icon, select a different element, and then click **OK**.

6.  Click **Save**.

7.  Repeat steps 2-6 as needed for other indexes and keys.

8.  Save the document cache component.
