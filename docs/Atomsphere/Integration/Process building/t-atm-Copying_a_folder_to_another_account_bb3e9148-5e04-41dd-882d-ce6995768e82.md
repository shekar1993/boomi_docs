If you have access to multiple accounts, you can copy component folders to another account. You can copy a folder to another location within one account or create a new folder.

1.  Click the blue arrow **![icon](../Images/main-ic-arrow-blue-down-16=GUID-CA79043B-869E-4C8B-A46E-5D4D4FA1DBEE=1=en-us=Low_ee257e3c-4362-486e-b1f1-4d613b679c4c.jpg)** next to the folder you want to copy.

2.  Select **Copy**.

    The Copy Folder dialog opens.

3.  To copy the folder to the same account, accept the default in the required **Copy to Account** field and skip to step 5. To copy the folder to another account, click the **Browse ![icon](../Images/main-ic-magnifying-glass-16_cd0f3352-63b0-4d15-af6d-86e11b9d14eb.jpg)** icon and select an account.

    The Choose Account dialog opens.

4.  Find the account, select it, and click **OK**.

5.  To copy component passwords, select the **Copy Passwords Across All Accounts** check box.

6.  To copy sub-folders, select the **Copy All Subfolders** check box.

7.  If you do not want to copy component dependents, clear the **Copy Component Dependents** check box.

    Component dependents, including those in other folders, are copied by default.

8.  In the **Destination Folder** field, click the **Browse ![icon](../Images/main-ic-magnifying-glass-16_cd0f3352-63b0-4d15-af6d-86e11b9d14eb.jpg)** icon and select a folder.

    If the destination folder has write restrictions on it and if you are not assigned a user role that allows write access to the folder, you can see the folder but you cannot select it. The folder icon has a gray lock ![icon](../Images/main-ic-folder-yellow-with-lock_f6a422b9-3994-4569-87ee-bc5c81c81d9a.jpg) on it.

    If the folder or any of the sub-folders that you are copying have write restrictions on them, those restrictions are not applied to the copies that you are creating.

9.  Alternatively, you can create and select a new folder location when copying and moving folders and components. Click the plus \(+\) symbol to create a new folder.

10. Click **OK**.
