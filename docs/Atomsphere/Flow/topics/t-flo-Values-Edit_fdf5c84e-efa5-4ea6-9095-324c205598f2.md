You can open and edit existing values from the **Values** page.

:::caution

Editing and saving a value will affect all flows in the tenant that currently use the value, and care should be taken to ensure that your changes do not adversely affect these other flows.

:::

To edit a value:

1.  Navigate to the **Values** page.
2.  Click the **Edit Value** icon ![Edit Value](../Images/img-flo-Action_Edit_a0e2bcdc-d94b-42f5-b937-3affc6881fda.png) in the **Actions** column, or click the value **Name**, in the value row that you wish to edit.
3.  The **Value** page is displayed.
4.  Edit the value as required.
5.  Click **Save Value** to save and commit your changes to the value. Once you have saved your changes, the value is updated and these changes are reflected in any flows in the tenant that use the value. Note that editing a value will not affect any in-flight flows as the flows are already running.
