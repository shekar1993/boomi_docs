Adding a condition group\(s\) to a business rule is an optional part of the process of configuring a business rule, which is a required step in adding a business rule data quality step to a model and an optional step in adding another type of data quality step.

# Procedure


1.  In the Conditions section of the Configure Business Rule screen, point in the desired level in the conditions hierarchy and click **Add a Group**.

    ![Click Add a Group as opposed to Add a Condition.](../Images/Models/main-ds-business-rule-add-condition-condition-group_6d39ea0e-60ca-49d1-a2b7-31ab6336d226.jpg)

    Links and controls for defining a condition group appear at the pointer location.

    ![Select the Boolean operator, either AND (the default) or OR.](../Images/Common/mdm-ds-add-rule-expression-group_a09509f2-28f8-4eab-9e76-afb145086ac9.jpg)

2.  In the **Group Level Operator** list, select the Boolean operator that will relate the conditions to be grouped â€” AND \(the default operator\) or OR.

3.  Click **Save**.

    Parentheses delimiting the newly defined condition group are shown. When you pause the pointer on the top delimiter, links appear enabling you to edit or remove the condition group.
