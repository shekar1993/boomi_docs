The Deployed Processes panel displays all deployed processes for the selected Atom, Molecule, or Cloud.

After selecting a process, you can edit its process properties in the Edit Process Properties dialog. You may want to change a process's properties or you may need to preset a property to a particular value when you are testing or troubleshooting a process and its resulting documents.

You can edit these types of process properties:

-   The date and/or time of the predefined properties `com.boomi.execution.lastrun` and `com.boomi.execution.lastsuccessfulrun`.

-   The property values of any process property components that you may have created. See the Process Property Components topic.

-   The property values of any dynamic process properties that you may have created. See the Dynamic Process Properties topic.
