**We added this feature:**

We enhanced the *Environment Settings* page for a more seamless experience when managing your environment tokens, including:

- A new alert banner to the Environment Tile and the Environment Overview page to inform you when your token(s) expire.

- A table that shows you the tokens you have for a particular region.

- A *Create a Token* button to create new tokens.

(ES-2136)
