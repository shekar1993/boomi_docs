You stop Atoms, Molecule nodes, and Cloud Molecules.

## Procedure

1.  Open a console window.

2.  Go to `<installation_directory>\bin` and execute the `atom stop` command.

    This stops the Atom, Molecule node, or Cloud Molecule if it is running. If the Atom, Molecule node, or Cloud Molecule is already stopped, then this command does nothing.
