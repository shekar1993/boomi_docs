It is possible to download a Custom asset that was added to a Bundle. A non-Bundle owner can also download a Custom asset created and added by other accounts.

To download a Custom asset:

In the **Assets** tab, select the Custom asset you want to download in the Bundle and click ![](../../images_bundles/img_bundles_download_icon.png).

This downloads the asset to your local machine.
