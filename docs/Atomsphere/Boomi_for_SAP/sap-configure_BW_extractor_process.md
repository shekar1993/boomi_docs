- If a Boomi for SAP connection has already been made, click the 'x' in the connection field to remove the Boomi for SAP Example. Then, select the previously created connection. It is recommended to reuse the configured connection as much as possible, per runtime, to optimize Boomi licenses, which are based on consumed connections by the runtime (Atom/Molecule).
- If there isn't an existing Boomi for SAP connection, click the **pencil icon** next to the Boomi for SAP Example.

- Fill in the required fields on the connection page. If you donâ€™t know the answers, contact the SAP team in your organization for assistance.
- Once all the fields are filled out, click the **Save and Close** button to return.
