Deploy packages to a runtime environment from the **Package Manager** page \(**Deploy** \> **Package Manager**\) or the **Deployments** page \(**Deploy** \> **Deployments**\).

After you build a deployable component and package that component, you can deploy the package to one or more environments.

You can deploy a package from:

- the [Package Manager page](t-atm-Creating_and_deploying_packages_from_PackageManager_a61138d5-8224-42df-9f93-45f4ac96813d.md) as part of a quick package and deploy wizard

- the [Deployments page](t-atm-Deploying_packages_from_the_Deployments_page_ede7b995-bef5-43ef-92c9-6f82104b1a99.md) while viewing a list of actively deployed packages
