Find an Atomâ€™s Java version and Java Home on the Startup Properties panel.

## Before you begin

Before upgrading a local Atom, Molecule, or private Atom Cloud, you need to know which version of Java it is currently using. You also need to know the path that your Atom or Molecule uses to access the JRE \(its Java.home\), or that your Cloud Molecule uses to access the JDK \(its JAVA\_HOME\).

## Procedure

1.  Go to **Manage** \> **Atom Management**.

2.  Select the Atom, Molecule, or Atom Cloud from the list on the left.

3.  In Information, click **Startup Properties**.

4.  Review the values in the following fields:

    -   **Java Version**

    -   **Java Home**
