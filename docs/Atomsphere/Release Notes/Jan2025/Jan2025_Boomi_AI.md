## Resolve

**We added these features:**

- The new and improved Boomi Resolve agent leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to help you quickly and thoroughly troubleshoot process errors by generating solutions and relevant article links. This new agent, accessible within process reporting, now leverages 148 times more help and community articles than the legacy Resolve feature. 

  Access the Resolve agent by navigating to **Manage** > **Process Reporting** > **Errors** in Integration. Select the timestamp of the process error to get started. Read [Boomi Resolve](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Integration%20management/c-atm-Boomi_Resolve_161e2c65-2c4d-45b8-a0ae-b107ddddac89.md) to learn more. (BI-6634)

## Scribe

**We added these features:**

- Scribe can now document any integration version and branch you are currently viewing on the Integration canvas. Read [Process canvas: Documenting integrations](/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/atm-BoomiAI_Generating_documentation_in_the_canvas.md) to learn more. (BI-7099)

- We updated the tooltip on the Integration canvas page in Scribe to clarify that documentation is generated for one process version at a time and is not saved within the platform. (BI-7327)

- Scribe now documents process schedules for integrations when you generate documentation in the process canvas. Read [Process canvas: Documenting integrations](/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/atm-BoomiAI_Generating_documentation_in_the_canvas.md) to learn more. (BI-7328)

<!-- **We fixed these issues:**

- Scribe hides the Export and Copy clipboard icons when you receive a regeneration error. This fix prevents you from exporting or copying blank documents. (BI-6920) -->
