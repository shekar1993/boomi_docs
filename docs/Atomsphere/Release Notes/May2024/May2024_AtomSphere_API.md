**We added this feature:**

- Added a new `SharedWebServerLog` object that enables you to download shared web server logs via the Platform API for your runtime. You can also retrieve the shared web server logs for your attachment to a cloud runtime. The object is available as an Execute action within the Boomi AtomSphere API and AtomSphere Partner API connectors. (RUN-6382, RUN-6546)
