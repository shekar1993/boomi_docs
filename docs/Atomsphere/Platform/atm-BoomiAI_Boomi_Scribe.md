Boomi Scribe boosts your productivity by generating summaries, descriptions, and documentation for AI-generated and existing integrations. Boomi Scribe’s process documentation describes the integration, its subprocesses, its components, operations, metadata, process schedules, and how data flows through each step and connector. It also includes visually engaging process diagrams generated by Boomi DesignGen. 

Boomi Scribe's comparison documentation details the additions, modifications, and deletions between two versions of an integration component or process.

With Boomi Scribe, you can:

- Generate process documentation and paste it into your content management system.
- Export documentation as a .docx file and open it in a .docx-supported editor like Google Docs.
- Generate process summaries to help your team understand business processes.
- Create process diagrams
- Document comparisons between process or component versions

### Document the differences between component and process versions in Boomi GPT

Boomi Scribe can create documentation explaining the differences between two versions of integration components or a process. It documents the additions, modifications, and deletions that occurred. Boomi Scribe also documents versions within different branches. Read [Documenting version differences](/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/atm-BoomiAI_Documenting_version_differences.md) for a detailed walkthrough.

## Prerequisites

To use Boomi Scribe, you must have the following: 

-   Integration Build Read Write access. Read [User roles and privileges](/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/c-atm-User_roles_and_privileges_5a1c8a1a-4d58-4e7d-a6b6-b684a0c6d672.md) to learn more about default Boomi Enterprise Platform roles and permissions.
-   Create Component API feature enabled on your account.
-   Agreement to the Boomi AI terms and conditions. Administrators can select the **AI icon** > **Get Started** to view and accept terms and conditions.

<!-- ## Important considerations

- Boomi Scribe currently supports the English language.
- It has no knowledge of previous documentation responses. You cannot refer to a previous prompt or response. To make adjustments to your prompt, copy and paste the previous prompt with your edits in the chat window.
- Boomi Scribe can only generate descriptions and documentation for one process within a single prompt in Boomi GPT. If you enter multiple processes, Boomi Scribe uses the most recently entered process for its response.
- Boomi Scribe does not support documentation for processes that include a cycle or loop.
- Boomi Scribe can document integrations with up to 100 steps. However, depending on the complexities of an integration, such as the number of configurations within each step, you may experience response errors while documenting integrations with less than 100 steps.
- Boomi Scribe only creates descriptions for process components. It does not support descriptions for other components, such as maps and connector actions.
- Steps that are disconnected from the process are not included in documentation.
- To successfully generate documentation for a process, you need permission to access all its associated components.
- If prompts do not contain sufficient details as outlined in the walkthroughs in [Generating Documentation for Existing Processes](/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/atm-BoomiAI_Create_Documentation_for_Existing_Process.md), GPT may redirect the request to the Boomi Answers agent to obtain the most relevant information related to the provided prompt. -->
