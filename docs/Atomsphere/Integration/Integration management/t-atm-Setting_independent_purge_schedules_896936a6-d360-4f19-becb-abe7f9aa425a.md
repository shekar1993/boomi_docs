Independent purge schedules, where specified, override the schedule set with **Purge History After X Days** in the Properties panel.

## Before you begin
You must have the Atom Management privilege to perform this task. If you have the Atom Management Read Access privilege, you cannot perform the task.

## Procedure

1.  Go to **Manage** \> **Atom Management**.

2.  Select the Atom, Molecule, or Cloud Molecule from the list on the left.

3.  In Settings & Configuration, click **Properties** \(for an Atom\) or **Account Properties** \(for a Molecule or Cloud\).

4.  In the Properties panel, click the **Advanced** tab.

5.  To set an independent purge schedule for components \(the number of days following process execution that purging of components occurs for processes run in test mode or as part of a browse operation\):

    1.  From the Property drop-down list, select the **Purge Schedule for Components** property, then click **Add Property**.

    2.  Add a number of days for the Purge Schedule for Components in the **Property Value** field.

6.  To set an independent purge schedule for logs \(the number of days following process execution that purging of the logs occurs\):

    1.  From the Property drop-down list, select the **Purge Schedule for Logs** property, then click **Add Property**.

    2.  Add a number of days for the Purge Schedule for Logs in the **Property Value** field.

7.  To set an independent purge schedule for processed documents \(the number of days following process execution that purging of the processed documents occurs, and processed document archiving, if enabled, also occurs\):

    1.  From the Property drop-down list, select the **Purge Schedule for Processed Documents** property, then click **Add Property**.

    2.  Add a number of days in the **Property Value** field.

8.  To set an independent purge schedule for temporary data \(the number of days following process execution that purging of the temporary data occurs\):

    1.  From the Property drop-down list, select the **Purge Schedule for Temporary Data**, then click **Add Property**.

    2.  Add a number of days in the **Property Value** field.

9.  Click **Save**.

    Changes to these properties do not take effect until the Atom, Molecule, or Cloud is restarted. You have the option to restart now or restart later.

## Results

If an Atom starts or restarts when its purge process is scheduled to run, the purge process does not run. Purging is delayed until the Atomâ€™s next scheduled purge interval. Purging can occur only when the Atom is online and communicating with the platform.
