You can remove any pending updates of an Atom or connectors you may have applied and roll back to the currently released version.

## Before you begin

Follow these steps to roll back the API Gateway updates and go back to the currently released version.

## Procedure

1.  Go to **Configure Server** \> **Gateways**, and select the Gateway you would like to rollback the version on.

2.  Click the Gateway Version panel and click **Select Rollback Versions**.

3.  Select the Gateway option and click **Apply Selected Rollbacks**.

4.  Click **Ok**.

    You return to the Gateway Version panel with a success message.

## Next steps
After the updates are applied and the page is refreshed, the API Gateway that was rolled back will display a version that matches the previously available version. The **Select Rollback Versions** button will not be available when any or all rollbacks are applied, regardless of when the Gateway takes the updates.
