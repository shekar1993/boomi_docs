Field groups typically have multiple member fields. Adding a field to a field group is a drag-and-drop operation.

## Before you begin

Before you can add a field to a field group you must first add the field group.

## Procedure

1.  In the **Fields** tab, drag the fieldâ€™s reorder icon ![](../Images/Common/main-ic-dots-16-gray-on-white_404b1c3f-e21a-4b67-ba76-65412d39eb70.jpg) and drop it on the field group.

    If the field group is expanded, the newly added field is immediately visible.
