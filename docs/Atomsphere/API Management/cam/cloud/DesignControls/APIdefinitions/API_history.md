**API History** provides the history of the changes made for the selected API definition. To see the API definition history, navigate to **Design > APIs** and select an API definition.

Access to the **API History** feature is available to API Management users who have rights to access the **API Settings** pages, which includes the following roles: 

- Administrator 

- Support User

- Organization Administrator 

- API Manager 

- Organization API Manager 

Once an API definition is selected, the **API History** page displays all the changes made to the API definition. Use the **Compare Selected** button to compare two versions of changes. Upon proper selection, a pop-up window displays the differences between the two versions.

Changes marked with red indicate deleted items, yellow are items which have been updated, and green indicates added items.
