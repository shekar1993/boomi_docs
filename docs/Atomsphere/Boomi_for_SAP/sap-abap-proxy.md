The ABAP Proxy serves as an interface for receiving or transferring data from the SAP system. Specifically, ABAP Proxy, provided by Boomi for SAP, enables seamless Middleware adjustments without disrupting the SAP Proxy framework pipeline.

ABAP Proxy executes various functions, including:

- Receiving updates to a data object: For instance, when a Business Partner undergoes modifications, ABAP Proxy sends a message to Boomi, prompting updates across other applications.
- Updating a data object: ABAP Proxy facilitates the updating of a Material within SAP by using master data sourced from an external application.
- Querying a complex data object: This involves retrieving a Business Partner object.
