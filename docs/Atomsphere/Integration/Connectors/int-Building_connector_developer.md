We are excited to announce the launch of our new Boomi Developer Documentation site at [developer.boomi.com](https://developer.boomi.com).

The following sections have moved from this site to the Developer Documentation site:

- Building a connector

- Connector Deployment API

- Connector Management API

On the new site, you will find relevant content that is easy to find and use in your journey as a Boomi Developer. The site will contain resources ranging from Getting Started guides to API reference, SDK logs, tutorials, code samples, advanced topics, and niche use cases. We’ve put a lot of thought and care into creating a content experience curated for developers.

Here are some highlights of the new site:

- [Integration Connectors](https://developer.boomi.com/docs/Connectors/Connectors_overview): Stay updated with connector building, deploying, and testing; from guides and code samples to our latest SDK changelog.

- [API Reference](https://developer.boomi.com/api/connectorgroup/): Seamlessly navigate through our connector APIs with the OpenAPI 3.0 spec – for API-related Connector deployment and management.

- [Tutorial Videos](https://developer.boomi.com/docs/Connectors/Tutorials_connectors): Learn fast and efficiently with a library of dynamic tutorials.

- [Code Samples](https://developer.boomi.com/codeSamples): Access Boomi’s wide range of Connector Project repositories and code samples right from the developer documentation website 

- [User Community](https://community.boomi.com/s/): Connect with the wider Developer community. Got a question? Find answers and share insights with the community.
