Before installing an Atom on Windows, ensure that your computer meets system requirements, you synchronize clocks, and you have administrator access for Windows.

Complete the following prerequisites, then install the Atom on Windows:


## Check Atom system requirements 

Check the [Atomâ€™s system requirements](./r-atm-Atom_system_requirements_e3656558-174d-438e-bc5a-6dd48d20c159.md).

## Synchronize clocks 

Ensure that the Atom's server clock, including central storage services (such as NFS), synchronize regularly. You can use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server to ensure synchronization.

## Obtain Administrator access 

Depending on the version of Windows you are running, you might need Administrator access to the system where you plan to install the local Atom.

## Install the Atom 

After complete the prerequisites, complete the following tasks in order. Links to the tasks are at the bottom of the topic.

:::caution Warning

If there are Unicode characters in the directory path to where you intend to install the Atom, the installation will fail.

:::

1. Download the Atom installer.

2. Install the local Atom on Windows.

3. (Optional) See the section about maintaining Atoms, Molecules and Atom Clouds. You might want to modify how the Atom runs, change default settings or even remove it.
