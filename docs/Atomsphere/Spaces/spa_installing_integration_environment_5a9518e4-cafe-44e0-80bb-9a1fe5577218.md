For a multi-environment configuration, the Edit integration feature allows you to install the integration in any environment that was skipped during the initial installation.

    To install the integration in an environment:

1. Sign in to the Space User portal.

2. Navigate to the **Installed** page.

3. In the search bar, type the name of the integration you want to install, and then click **Edit**.

    On the **Edit Integration** page, the Environments table displays all the environments added to the integration, wth their attachment status, installation status, and the actions you can perform.

4.  On the **Action** column of the environments table, click **Install** and follow the steps mentioned in the [Installing multi installion](/docs/Atomsphere/Boomi_Labs/Spaces/Getting_started/User_Space/installing_multi_installation.md) topic to finish installing the integration in an environment.
