The Email connector allows you to connect to an email provider and send emails directly from a flow.

## Overview

The connector is most commonly used to integrate email functionality so that simple asynchronous emails can be configured and triggered to send at defined points within a flow. ![Step 1](../Images/img-flo-Step1_ed936f88-97de-4cc1-98ac-9f351a84a1bb.png)

The connector can also be used as part of a flow approval process, by sending synchronous emails that require a decision from an email recipient before the flow can continue progressing along the chosen outcome path. ![Step 2](../Images/img-flo-Step2_c61b5577-5d61-4de6-9cfd-7eb5f4587ce0.png)

![Using the](../Images/img-flo-Email_service_5ce92679-2e4f-48f4-a0c6-43c2f6f46906.png)

To use the it, you must first be installed into a tenant and configured. It can then be imported into a flow as a shared element.

The configuration values for the will depend on your email provider. For example, to send emails from a Gmail account you will need to configure the with a different SMTP server name than if you are sending emails from a Microsoft Exchange/Office 365 account.

## Message actions and send types

Once installed and imported into a flow, the connector can be integrated using a message map element and message action.

There are several different types of message action available for the connector:
