The **General** tab allows Portal administrators to set the Portal name, which is the name of the client Portal. The Portal name appears at the top of all the pages on the Dashboard. This tab contains links to other sub tabs under Portal Settings. The sub-tabs can be opened by clicking the links given in the **Portal Settings Guide** section or on the menu bar at the top.
