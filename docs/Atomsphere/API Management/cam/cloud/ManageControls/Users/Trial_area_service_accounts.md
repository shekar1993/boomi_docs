When a API Management Trial Service Account is created, you will need to set a password for the Service Account. This gives the Service Account access to the Boomi Cloud™ Integration trial evaluation area. 

To set the password for a API Management Trial Service Account: 

1. Click **Manage > Users** to display the **Users** page. 

2. Verify that the API Management Trial Service Account is in the All Users list. Take note of the **Username** and **Email** for the Service Account.

3. Go to the Service Account user's API Management evaluation portal and click **Recover password**.

4. In the **Recover Password** window, enter the **Email** and **Username** from Step 2, then click **Send Email**.

   The Service Account user will receive an e-mail from "Mashery.com Registrations" with a link to reset the password. The new password must contain at least one letter, one number, and have at least 8 characters. 

The Administrator can now continue with managing the Service Account user's access settings, as needed.
