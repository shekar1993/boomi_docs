## Developer page 

**Fix**:

-   Connector developers could not see the review status of a connector version on the Developer page. With this fix, developers can see the review status regardless of their privileges. If a developer has the privilege to submit a connector version for public approval, they will be able to accomplish this task from a link in the Review Status column. \(CON-7413\)
  
This fix is not in the Runtime Release.
