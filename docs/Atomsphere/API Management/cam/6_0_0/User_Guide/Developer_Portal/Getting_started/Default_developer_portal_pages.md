The Developer Portal gives you several developer-facing integrations for interacting with your APIs: 

- Home

- Applications

- Keys

- Interactive APIs

## Home

The **Home** page is the landing page for your Developer Portal and the gateway to your API community. Use it to welcome your users to your Developer Portal, direct them to your Developer Portal's APIs, and provide clear steps on how to become a community member, including how to register for a developer key. 

## Applications

The **Applications** page displays all the registered applications.

## Keys

A Package Key is given to a developer to access a set of services, endpoints, and methods as defined in the respective Package Plan. A plan associated with a Package Key can be replaced with another plan in the same package without changing the key string and without requiring a developer to change the application code. 

The **Keys** page displays a list of package keys owned by the users in the system. 

## Interactive APIs

The **Interactive APIs** page is an interactive documentation system for RESTful and SOAP-based APIs that are registered on the Developer Portal.
