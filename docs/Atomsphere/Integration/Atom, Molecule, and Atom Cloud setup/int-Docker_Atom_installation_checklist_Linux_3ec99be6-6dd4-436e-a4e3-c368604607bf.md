Before you can install the Docker Atom on Linux, ensure that your computer meets the system requirements and you synchronize clocks.

Complete the following prerequisites, then install the Docker Atom on Linux:

## Check Docker Atom system requirements 

Check the [Docker Atom’s system requirements](./r-atm-Docker_Atom_system_requirements_528c616e-042f-4cc1-b9d2-e8e6bc4d8533.mdx).

## Synchronize clocks 

Ensure that the Atom's server clock, including central storage services (such as NFS), synchronize regularly. You can use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server.

## Install the Docker Atom 

After you complete the prerequisites above, complete the following tasks in order.

1. Download the local Atom installer and select the Docker 64–bit option.

2. Run the Docker installer file.

   :::note

   Docker must be running on the computer where you run the installer.

3. (Optional) See the section about maintaining Atoms, Molecules and Atom Clouds. You might want to modify how the Atom runs, change default settings, or even remove it.
