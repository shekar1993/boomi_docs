You can explore the catalog by browsing the various functionalities present on the homepage or using the menus to perform various operations on the current page. These operations are similar to CRUD operations.


## Menus
The following are the main navigation options in the API Control Center dashboard:

- [Design](../DesignControls/Overview_of_the_design_controls.md): Provides controls for configuring API definitions, API packages, notification emails, response filters, and I/O docs.

- [Manage](../ManageControls/Overview_of_the_manage_controls.md): Provides controls for creating content for your developer portal, and for managing users, application package keys, organizations, and portal access groups.

- [Deploy](../DeployControls/Overview_of_the_deploy_controls.md): Provides controls for monitoring the configuration for the Boomi Cloud™ API Management - Local Edition on-premises solution (if you have it), specifically, cluster information and sync history.  

- [Analyze](../AnalyzeControls/Overview_of_the_analyze_controls.md): Provides controls to view API reporting information on three levels: high-level (Executive Summary), medium-level (Reports application), and low-level (Call Log Export and Call Inspector).

With API Control Center menus, you can:
- Create an API definition
- Set up APIs, endpoints, and methods
- Create packages and plans
- Register users and applications
- Specify rate limiting for developers
- Configure API authentication
