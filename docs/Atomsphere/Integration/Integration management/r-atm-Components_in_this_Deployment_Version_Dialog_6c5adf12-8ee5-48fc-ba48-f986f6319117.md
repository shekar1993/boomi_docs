## Component revision list 

For each component revision used in the execution, the following properties are shown:

-   Name — component name

-   Type — component type

-   Revision — revision number

-   Modified By — name and email address of the user who saved this revision

-   Modified — date and time when this revision was saved


Clicking **![View/Edit](../Images/main-ic-document-pencil-green_6e088023-a564-479a-a854-937b89c72d05.jpg) View/Edit this revision of the component** for a component opens that revision of the component in a new browser tab or window. If this is not the latest revision of the component, a banner at the top warns you of this.

:::caution

If you edit and save an earlier revision of a component, the latest revision is overwritten and no longer available.
