When you're on the process canvas, you can display or hide the steps palette. The steps palette allows you to find any step and drag it onto the canvas. You can search all steps or choose a category, **Connect**, **Execute**, or **Logic**, and scroll to find the step you want.

## Procedure

1. To display the steps, click the Steps icon (![The Steps icon is represented by a white curved arrow inside a blue circle](../Images/img-int-BC_Steps.jpg))

   ![The steps palette open on the process canvas](../Images/img-int-BC_Steps_palette_open.png)

2. To hide the steps, click the Steps icon again.
