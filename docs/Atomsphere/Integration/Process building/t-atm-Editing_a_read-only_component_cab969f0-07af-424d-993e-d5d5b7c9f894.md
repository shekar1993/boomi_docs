If component locking is enabled in your Enterprise or Enterprise Plus Edition account, when you open any type of component it opens on the Build page with a yellow banner indicating that it is in read-only mode. To ensure that you and no one else can edit the component at this time, you must lock it before editing it.

## Procedure

1.  In the Component Explorer, navigate to the folder containing the component.

2.  Double-click the component.

    The component opens on a tab on the process canvas in read-only mode.

3.  Click **Lock & Edit**.

    If the component is available for editing and you have the latest revision it opens in edit mode.

    If the component is being edited by another user, you will see a message indicating that the component locked and the name of the user who has locked it.

    If the component is available for editing but you do not have the latest revision, go to the task linked below: [To Select and Edit a Revision of a Read-Only Component.](./t-atm-Selecting_and_editing_a_revision_of_a_read-only_comp_da237395-8953-4d15-937c-a132bc44a7a1.md)

4.  Do one of the following:

    -   If the component is available for editing and you have the latest revision, edit the component.

    -   If the component is being edited by another user and you do not have an Administrator role, close the component.

    -   If the component is being edited by another user and you have an Administrator role and want to edit the component, click **Acquire Lock** and then edit the component.

    -   If the component is being edited by you \(the “current user”\) because you had accidentally exited without saving the component, click **Acquire Lock** and then edit the component.

5.  If you were able to edit the component, click **Save** or **Save and Close**.
