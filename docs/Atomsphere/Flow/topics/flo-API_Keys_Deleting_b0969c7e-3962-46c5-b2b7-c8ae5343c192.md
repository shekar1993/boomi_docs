You can delete an API key on the **User Settings** page.

Deleting an API key means that any future requests made to the Rest API using the deleted API key are no longer authenticated and will fail.

:::caution

Deleting API keys is permanent and cannot be undone.

:::

1. Navigate to the **Generate a new API key** section on the **User Settings** page. See [User settings](flo-User_Settings_a75df92d-0c13-4468-a57f-4ea66101ccd8.md).

2. In the **API keys** table, click the **Delete** icon in the **Actions** column for the API key that you wish to delete.

3. The **Are you sure you want to remove this key?** form is displayed:

   - Click **Delete** to delete the API key.
   - Click **Cancel** to cancel the deletion and return to the **User Settings** page.

4. If you have chosen to delete the API key, a message is displayed to indicate that the API key has been deleted.
