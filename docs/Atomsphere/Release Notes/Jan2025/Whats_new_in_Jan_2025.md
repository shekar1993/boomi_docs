## Boomi Enterprise Platform Release Cadence Change

As of January 2025, the Boomi Enterprise Platform release cadence is following a new schedule. Boomi is making this change to streamline planning, ensure compliance, and continue to provide a predictable change schedule. 

This new release schedule includes functional releases in alternating months, as outlined below. The monthly maintenance window for releases continues to be limited to 4 hours.

### 2025 Release Schedule:

|Platform Releases|
|------|
|January, March, May, July, September, November|

Critical bug fixes, essential infrastructure updates, several independently operating services, and connectors remain outside of this cadence to ensure flexibility. The expected impact of such updates is a group of service restarts, expected to last just a few minutes.
