Administrator user accounts can be removed from an Organization by an Organization Administrator, so that the user only has standard access within the Organization.

:::caution

Removing Administrator access from a user account is permanent. A new Administrator invitation will need to be sent to the user account if you wish to grant Administrator privileges to the user again.

2.  In the **Current Administrators** table, click the **Delete** icon in the **Actions** column in the row for the user that you wish to remove as an Administrator from the Organization.
3.  The **Remove Administrator** form is displayed:
    -   Click **Remove** to remove Administrator privileges from the user for the Organization.

    -   Click **Cancel** to cancel the Administrator removal and return to the **Organization Settings** page.

4.  If you have confirmed the Administrator removal, the user account will no longer be able to access Administrator functionality within the Organization. See [Organization Settings page](flo-Organizations_Page_5d231fef-6306-42be-83b1-606ea13293df.md).
    -   The **Current Administrators** table updates to reflect the Administrator removal.

    -   The user account receives an email invitation informing them that they are no longer an Administrator within the Organization.
