Prior to publishing your listing, you are required to complete a test user subscription to at least one quantity of all the dimensions (plans) for your API Marketplace listing. Once API Management sees the entitlements coming through the API that represent the dimension codes for each dimension, you will then be able to publish your listing. For more information, see [Publishing Your API Marketplace Listing](Publishing_your_api_marketplace_listing.md).
