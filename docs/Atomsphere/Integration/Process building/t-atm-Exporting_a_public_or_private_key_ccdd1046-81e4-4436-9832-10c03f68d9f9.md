You might want to export a public key for a public certificate to give to your trading partner \(or other client application\) to encrypt the data that they send you. Exporting of both public and private keys is allowed only for private certificates.

## Procedure

1.  On the **Build** page, open an existing private or public certificate.

2.  If you opened a public or private certificate, click **Export Public Cert**.

    A dialog opens showing you the file name and prompting you to open or save the file.

3.  Do one of the following:

    -   Click **Open** and **Browse** to select an application, then **OK**.

    -   Click **Save** then **OK**.

    The file is opened or saved.

4.  If you opened a private certificate, click **Export Private Key**.

    A dialog opens showing the file name and prompting you to open or save the file.

5.  Do one of the following:

    -   Click **Open** and **Browse** to select an application, then click **OK**.

    -   Click **Save** then click **OK**.

    The file is opened or saved.
