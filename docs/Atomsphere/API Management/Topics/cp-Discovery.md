Discovery is the easiest and fastest way to establish the Boomi API Control Plane as the single point of truth in your landscape. 

## APIs

The API Control Plane searches for APIs in each connected environment that are not yet managed by it. It also imports the versions of the API and its documentation. Specification files are automatically detected and checked.

## API Products

If the provider natively supports products, the Control Plane will adopt them as well.

## Plans, Applications and Subscriptions

The already existing plans, applications and subscriptions (api-keys) are recognized and integrated into the API Control Plane.
