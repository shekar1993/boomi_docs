As an account administrator, use the **Settings** \> **Account Information and Setup** \> **Security** page to enable accounts to require two-factor authentication \(2FA\).

## About this task

As an account administrator, you may require all users of an account to use 2FA when logging or switching into an account. Requiring 2FA for accounts ensures greater security for the data, processes, and users that exist in that account.

## Procedure

1. Select **Settings** \> **Account Information and Setup** and click the **Security** tab.

2. Under the **Two-factor Authentication** tab, toggle on **Enforce two-factor authentication for accounts**.

    A warning message states that enabling 2FA requires users to configure it for their own user ID.

3. Click **OK** to continue.

4. Click **Save**.

## Results

2FA is now configured successfully on the account. Anytime a user attempts to log or switch into the account, users are prompted to configure 2FA on their user ID if they have not already done so.
