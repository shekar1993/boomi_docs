As the owner of a private Atom Cloud, once you enable processed document archiving for your Atom Cloud, you can then allow a particular tenant or all tenants to optionally enable processed document archiving.

## Procedure

1.  In Cloud Management \(**Manage** \> **Cloud Management**\), select the Atom Cloud.

2.  Select the **Attachment Quotas** tab.

3.  Do one of the following:

    -   To allow a particular tenant to optionally enable processed document archiving, in the attachments list, select the tenant Atom by its Atom instance ID.

    -   To allow all tenants to optionally enable processed document archiving, in the attachments list, select the Atom Cloud.

4.  In the properties table, set the **Enable Processed Document Archiving** property value to true.

5.  Click **Save**.

## Next steps

For a tenant to then enable processed document archiving, they must follow the steps in the linked topic about archiving processed documents on an Atom attached to a private Atom Cloud.
