Build and use your own custom user interface components in Flow.

## Overview

Flow comes with a set of pre-built page components that you can use to add standard user interface features and functionality into your flow pages.

If you require a user interface feature that is not provided by these components, you can build a custom component instead, add it to your tenant, and use it in a page just like a standard component.

For example, you can build a custom component to extend the functionality of the standard table component, or to provide a completely new type of feature, such as a QR code reader, or a signature pad input component.

Once you have built a custom component, you can export it and reuse it across other tenants and flows.
