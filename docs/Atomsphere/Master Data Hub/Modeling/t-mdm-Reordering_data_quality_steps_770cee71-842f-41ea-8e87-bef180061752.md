You can change the order in which data quality steps in a model are applied, in reaction to changes in requirements.

## Procedure

1.  In the **Data Quality Steps** tab, drag and drop reorder icons ![](../Images/Common/main-ic-dots-16-gray-on-white_404b1c3f-e21a-4b67-ba76-65412d39eb70.jpg) for data quality steps until they are in the desired order.

    As you drag a reorder icon, a dashed horizontal line dynamically shows the position into which the data quality step would be moved if you were to drop the icon at the pointer location.
