You can terminate a pending process regardless of whether it has been active in the last 15 minutes.

## Procedure

1.  Select **Manage** \> **Process Reporting**.

2.  Find the pending process execution.

    The ![Light blue information icon](../Images/main-ic-clock-blue-19_9cb26506-f75f-4cb4-996b-acb251c5c195.jpg) icon identifies pending process executions.

3.  Do one of the following:

    -   In the **![Gear or Actions icon](../Images/main-ic-gear-blue-and-arrow-black-16_188e61d7-2204-48ad-b085-15fa4a70615d.jpg) Actions** menu for that execution, select **![Red X](../Images/main-ic-x-red-stylized-16_5cfc1d0e-0ef7-44cc-bacf-4b4116afca79.jpg) Terminate Process Execution**.

    -   Click the date/time link for that execution to go to its detail view and in the **![Gear or Actions icon](../Images/main-ic-gear-gray_54d864eb-b5de-4ee6-9b31-975dae0a5762.jpg) Actions** menu, select **![Red X](../Images/main-ic-x-red-stylized-16_5cfc1d0e-0ef7-44cc-bacf-4b4116afca79.jpg) Terminate Process Execution**.

4.  In the confirmation dialog, click **OK** to confirm that you want to terminate the process.

    One of the following occurs:

    -   If the process has been active within the last 15 minutes, then an alert box informs you that termination may take up to a minute. The execution may complete successfully within that minute. Otherwise the process will be terminated.

    -   If the process has not been active within the last 15 minutes, then it will be aborted.

5.  To return to the view from which you initiated the termination, click **Close**.
