You can customize and save settings for the custom scripting code editor, including font size, tab indentation, highlighting, and color scheme.

## About this task

Custom settings can be specified anywhere that the code editor is accessible. You can customize the editor while you are creating a Scripting component, adding a custom scripting step to a process, configuring a custom scripting function, or editing SQL statements. The settings that you specify are in effect for every instance of the editor and they persist across user sessions.
