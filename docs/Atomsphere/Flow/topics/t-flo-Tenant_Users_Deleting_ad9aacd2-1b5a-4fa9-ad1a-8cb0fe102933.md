You can remove users from a tenant on the **Tenant** page.

-   Only Administrator users can remove users from a tenant.

-   Previously removed users can be added to a tenant again.

-   You can remove yourself from a tenant if required, as long as you are an Administrator user. This feature should be used with caution, to avoid accidentally locking yourself out of a tenant.
