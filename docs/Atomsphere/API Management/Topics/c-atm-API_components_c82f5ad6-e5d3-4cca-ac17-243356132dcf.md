There are two types of API components, both of which are deployable and created in on the Build page:

-   [API Service components](/docs/Atomsphere/API%20Management/Topics/int-API_Service_components_8f868bda-5099-4e1f-ad16-5648f98b68b2.md) define API endpoints.

-   [API Proxy components](/docs/Atomsphere/API%20Management/Topics/int-API_Proxy_components_24a9612a-2e4a-4ae9-ba66-88ba1b3f9c97.md) allow for the direct proxying of a request through an API Gateway to a service which is not served through an Atom, Molecule, or Atom Cloud.
