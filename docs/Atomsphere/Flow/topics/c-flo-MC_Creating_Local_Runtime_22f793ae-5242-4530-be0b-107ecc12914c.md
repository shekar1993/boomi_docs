This topic provides an overview of the steps involved in setting up a Flow local runtime.

## Installing a local runtime

Local runtimes are installed and set up using a Flow Docker image. The Docker local runtime packages up the local runtime installation into a single easily-installable image.

:::caution

The local runtime Flow Docker image must be installed on a 64â€“bit Linux machine. The minimum supported Docker version is 19.03.8. Installation on a Windows Operating System is not supported.

## Setting up a local runtime HTML5 player

Once you have set up a local runtime, your local runtime player configuration needs to be defined in order to allow users to view local runtime flows in a web browser. As the local runtime does not access the Flow cloud, a local HTML5 player needs to be created and configured so that the local runtime can access the player and use it to render your local runtime flow(s) in a web browser.

- [Local runtime HTML5 player setup](c-flo-MC_Players_f418374c-f634-42a0-8d7a-b330c69107d5.md)

:::note

A local runtime HTML5 player is not a requirement when using local runtimes if your flows will not be run in a web browser, as your Organization may deliver flows using the API, a custom user interface, or a connector such as Twilio for example.

## Upgrading local runtimes

Upgrading to a new version of a local runtime can be performed by changing the version number in your deployment manifests, and then performing a restart of all runtime instances.

## Runtime health checking

A health API endpoint can be used to monitor the general system health of a runtime.

## Runtime observability

Observability data can be exported for runtime environments. As well as basic error logging, more detailed system-level OpenTelemetry data can be exported from a runtime environment and sent to an OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) endpoint/APM system.
