You can download the deployed connections report for the Test and Production connector classes.

## About this task

You can click on **Generate Report** and **Download** the detailed deployed connection CSV report by selecting the required Test or Production Connector class. ONLY one connector class should be selected at a time before generating the report. If you have already created a *Generate Report* request, you should download the previous request report before creating a new one.

## Procedure

1. Go to the **Licensing** tab on the **Settings** page.

2. Select a connector class in the **Connections by Class** table.

3. Click on **Generate Report**.

4. Click **Download** to download the report.

   The CSV report for the selected connector class will be automatically downloaded with the name *ConnectionLicensing_accountId_Datetimestamp.csv*.
