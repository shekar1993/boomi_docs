The steps for filtering a list are the same across Boomi applications.

-   In the following, lists are subject to filtering:

    -   Deployed models in the **Summary** tab

    -   Sources in the Sources page and the **Sources** tab

    -   Models in the Models page

## Procedure


1.  Type in the filter field above the list.

    As you type the list is filtered to include only entities whose names partially or completely match the typed characters.

2.  To discontinue filtering and restore the unfiltered list, click ![x](../Images/Common/main-ic-x-white-in-gray-circle-16_0abafeee-d5e7-4888-9bfb-475b11b6d00f.jpg).
