Data Collection is automatically set in your account. As a result, de-identified statistical data and information is generated and collected based on your regular use of the Boomi Enterprise Platform. The data helps improve your experience with the platform and it's services. If you wish, you can manually opt out.

## About this task

If you opt out of Data Collection, your product functionality is not affected. However, Boomi cannot consider your data and information when developing future product features and updates. Furthermore, your account does not participate in, nor does it benefit from the features. You will not get recommendations to build your processes faster. Additionally, [DataDetective](../Platform/atm-BoomiAI_PII_Insights.md) is no longer accessible if you choose to opt out. Any data that has already been collected for your account will be removed in 24 hours. If you opt back in before the data is removed, the data is not removed.

:::tip

If your account is opted in to Data Collection when it should not be, opt out by toggling the Data Collection setting to OFF. This setting is only available to account administrators. If you are an account administrator and do not see the option, contact your Boomi account administrator. After verifying your identity, administration users then contact Boomi Support on your behalf. Allow Support up to two business days to opt your account out of Data Collection.
