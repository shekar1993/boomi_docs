You can delete assets from a Bundle if you no longer want to share them in the Bundle. You can only delete assets from a Bundle if you own the Bundle.

To delete an asset from a Bundle:
1. In the **Assets** tab, select the asset you want to delete in the Bundle and click ![](Images/img_bundles_delete_icon.png).

    A confirmation dialog opens. 

2. Click **Delete** to confirm.
