The Oracle E-Business Suite \(EBS\) V2 connector \(classified as an Enterprise connector\) allows you to connect to an Oracle EBS instance. You can interact with Oracle EBS based on the applicable Interface types defined in the Oracle Integration Repository, or establish a direct connection to the Oracle Database via Oracle JDBC drivers.

## Features

The Oracle E-Business Suite V2 connector supports the following features to connect to Oracle EBS systems:

-   Perform REST\_Query and REST\_Execute operations on the Oracle EBS data through the REST APIs defined in the Oracle Integration Repository.
-   Perform PLSQL\_Execute operations by calling Oracle PL/SQL stored procedures.
-   Query the required E-Business database tables by executing PLSQL queries via PLSQL\_Query.
-   Perform LISTEN operations for XML Gateway and Business Event Messages, and SEND operations for XML Gateway Messages.
-   Establish secured database connections using the database connect descriptor \(DBC\) file.

Through this connector, you can use a process to interface with different types of Oracle EBS Interfaces. You can browse the list of available APIs for a given interface type in your Oracle EBS Integration Repository, and automatically generate the request and response profiles in XML format to use in processes and maps.

## Supported authentication types

The connector supports any of the following authentication types for secured access of the REST services:

-   HTTP Basic Authentication \(Username and Password\)
-   Token-based Authentication \(Username and a valid token, such as Oracle EBS session ID\)
-   Oracle Database User and Password credential
-   DBC file-based authentication

## Supported interface types

The connector supports the following Interface types:

REST\_EXECUTE and REST\_QUERY operations

-   PL/SQL
-   Open Interface
-   Java \(Subtype: Java Bean Services\)

Defined via

-   **Oracle EBS Integrated SOA Gateway** - Responsible for allowing service enablement.
-   **Oracle Integration Repository** - Central Repository storing all service-related business interfaces. It contains numerous interface endpoints exposed by applications throughout the entire Oracle EBS and enables to easily discover and search on interfaces, regardless of Oracle native or custom ones.

The connector uses a Rest Service Locator API in the Integration Repository to search for all deployed EBS REST APIs. The Rest Service Locator is a sample Java API that consists of methods to retrieve details about the deployed Oracle EBS’ REST APIs. For more information, see the topic [Setting up the REST Service Locator](int-Oracle_EBS_V2_setting_up_the_REST_service_locator_d180e7c1-081b-4325-832e-0995748f23cd.md).

PLSQL\_Execute and PLSQL\_Query operations

-   Execute PL/SQL stored procedures defined via Oracle Integration Repository in the Oracle EBS are accessible.
-   Basic PL/SQL SELECT queries.

LISTEN and SEND operations

-   Listening XML Gateway Messages from ECX\_OUTBOUND queue
-   Sending XML Gateway Messages to ECX\_INBOUND queue
-   Listening Business Event Messages from WF\_BPEL\_Q queue

The connector supports the following operations using the supported interface types:

-   REST\_EXECUTE operation invokes Oracle PL/SQL APIs \(Native and Custom PL/SQL\) deployed in the Oracle Integration Repository, to perform certain actions in the Oracle EBS based on the request input.

    :::note
    
    The native and custom APIs must be deployed in the Integration Repository, to make the APIs available for use in the connector. For more information, see the Prerequisites section in this topic.
    
    :::

-   REST\_QUERY operation invokes Open Interface and Java \(Java Bean Services\) APIs to retrieve required EBS data based on the user defined filters. To verify if your Open Interface/JAVA APIs support the QUERY operation, see the Prerequisites section in this topic.
-   PLSQL\_EXECUTE operation calling Oracle PL/SQL stored procedures as defined in the Oracle Integration Repository PL/SQL interfaces. PL/SQL procedures are categorized by module, package, and procedure name. The Oracle EBS connector supports stored procedures with the collection types TABLE, ARRAY, and VARRAY as arguments.
-   PLSQL\_QUERY operation that executes SQL SELECT queries for E-Business database table for which you define the returned fields, specify nested filter expressions, and return results sorted by one or more fields.
-   LISTEN operation that retrieves XML Gateway messages from the ECX\_OUTBOUND queue and Business Event messages from the WF\_BPEL\_Q queue.
-   SEND operation where XML Gateway messages are enqueued into ECX\_INBOUND.

## Connector configuration

To configure the connector to communicate with Oracle EBS, set up the following two components:

-   Oracle EBS connection — The connection represents a specific Oracle EBS instance and its associated user authentication method.
-   Oracle EBS operation — The operation represents an action against a specific E-Business Integration scenario such as Execution of PL/SQL interfaces to execute actions in Oracle EBS as per the Request Input, Querying the Open Interface and Java APIs to retrieve required Oracle EBS data, Execution of Oracle PL/SQL stored procedures, Querying for required Oracle EBS data by executing PL/SQL queries on the E-Business database tables. With LISTEN and SEND operations, the connector allows you to integrate with Oracle E-Business Suite for XML Gateway and Business Event Messages. The LISTEN operation is for receiving XML Gateway and Business Event messages from ECX\_OUTBOUND Queue and WF\_BPEL\_Q Queue respectively. The SEND operation is for sending XML Gateway messages to ECX\_INBOUND queue.

This design provides reusable components containing connection settings \(such as URL, username, password\) and operation settings \(such as object, action, data definitions\). After building the connection and operation, set up your connector within a process. When the process is configured properly, can map to and from virtually any system using the Oracle EBS V2 connector to communicate with Oracle EBS.


:::note

A separate connection is required for REST vs. PL/SQL, LISTEN, SEND. REST operation requires only API details. However, PL/SQL, LISTEN, SEND requires DB details. You have to provide either DB schema details or use the DBC file option for the connection.
