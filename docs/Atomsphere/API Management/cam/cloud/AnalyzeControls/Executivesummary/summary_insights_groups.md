## Selecting the period of interest for all Summary Insight Groups

All Summary Insight Groups contain metrics and trends with respect to a selected period of interest. Available periods for selection (L**ast Week, Last Month, or Last Quarter**) are with respect to the time span when a user navigates to the feature. 

To view the Executive Summary Insight Groups: 

- Click **Last Week, Last Month or Last Quarter**. 

The respective date range (that is, the start date and the end date) is displayed adjacent to Last Quarter. The **Management Summary, Technical Summary,** and **Developer Summary** are populated according to the selected period.

**The Executive Summary** page and the **Heat Map** are populated only if sufficient data is available. For example, if you are a new customer and are using the Control Center for less than a week, the **Executive Summary** page does not display any data.
