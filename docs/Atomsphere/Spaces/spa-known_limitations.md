Spaces has the following limitations that are being worked upon to address in future releases:

**Space User Interface**

- Browsing two Space User Interfaces simultaneously on a browser is currently not supported. 

- Process properties components that have allowable values set, do not check for those allowed values in Spaces.  A user is unable to see the drop-down of allowed values and can proceed even when the value is entered incorrectly.

**Environment Extensions**

- Unable to decrypt an extended password on the Sub Account

- Unable to hide and an extended field in Spaces when the value is set by the Admin

**Login**

- No Support for 3rd Party IDP
