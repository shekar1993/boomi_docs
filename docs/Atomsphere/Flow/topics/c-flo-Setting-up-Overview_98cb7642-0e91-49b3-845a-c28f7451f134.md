Once you have signed in to Flow, you can begin the process of setting up and managing your flows.

The **Flows** page is the first screen you will see once you have signed in to Flow.

-   Click **New Flow** to create a new flow from a blank canvas. See [Flows](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/c-flo-Flows_Overview_263d2c58-b3b9-463b-92c3-b828eb3362ea.md).


## Setting up your flows

The left-hand menu provides quick access to the main pages you use for setting up and managing your flows.
