You can edit the map if you need to change the mappings or either of its profiles.

## Procedure

1.  Open the map.

2.  To select a different source or destination profile, in either the **Map Source** or **Map Destination** column, click **Choose**, and select a different profile.

    Alternatively, drag a profile into either column.

    :::caution

    Selecting a different profile clears all connections between elements from the map. To maintain connections, edit the profiles instead \(see step 3\).

    :::

3.  To edit a source or destination profile, click on the name of the profile, and edit the profile.

4.  Click the plus signs in both profiles to show the connections between elements.

5.  Add or change connections by clicking and dragging lines.

6.  To delete a connection, click and drag the destination element and drag the line to the left, toward the source element.

7.  Click **Save**.
