## APIs in Card Layout

The APIs are displayed in a card layout format, each card representing a unique API. The cards include essential information: an icon, name, tags, and a brief description. 

Filter and Search Functionality
To the left, a "FILTER BY TAG" section includes tags, reflecting different characteristics or categorizations of the APIs. This filtering mechanism allows for quick navigation between services. At the top, a search bar with an option for "[Use Full Text Search](../Topics/cp-Full_text_search.md)" offers an additional layer of search capabilities, expanding the scope to include comprehensive data within the API descriptions.
