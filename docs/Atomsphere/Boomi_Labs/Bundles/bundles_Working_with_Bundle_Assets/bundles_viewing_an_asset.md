The view option lets you view the details of assets added to a Bundle. You can view details of assets that you have added and even those added by others. You can view details of an Integration asset and a Flow asset, whereas this option is unavailable for a Custom asset.

To view details of an Integration asset:
1. In the **Assets** tab, select the asset you want to view in the Bundle and click ![](../../images_bundles/img_bundles_view_icon.png).

    The **Packaged Components** page opens in a new tab. 

2. View the details.
