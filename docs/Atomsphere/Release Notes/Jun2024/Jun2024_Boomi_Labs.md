## Spaces

**We added these features:**

- We implemented trimming for process names that have more than 65 characters. (OEMSPACES-336)

- For the Schedule page, we now expanded one schedule when first accessing the page. Additionally, we changed the **Save** and **Cancel** button placement to the top of the page. (OEMSPACES- 383, OEMSPACES- 60)

- For Data Map configurations within Spaces, we enhanced the UI so that the **Apply** button is disabled until you check the box to map the element. (OEMSPACES- 227)

- We implemented UI changes to improve the look and feel, such as removing schedule status icons, replacing **Filter** with **Search** in search bars, and adjusting table alignment for the **Select Environment** page. (OEMSPACES-384)
