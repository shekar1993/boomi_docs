Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is the exchange of business data from one computer to another using a public standard format. It replaces the traditional processes of preparing data in paper form and sending it by mail or fax. Business-to-business (B2B) solutions integrate data between two or more different companies or organizations.

These groups or trading partners use interoperability standards like XML or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). EDI standards, such as ASC X12, HL7, ODETTE, RosettaNet, Tradacoms, and UN/EDIFACT, define how to transfer documents by prescribing formats, character sets, and data elements for specific industries or countries. B2B commerce might need the additional flexibility offered by XML and API standards for passing information. B2B e-commerce requirements differ from typical intra-organization and application-to-application integration requirements by:

- Validating data against EDI standards

- Acknowledging receipt and submissions of documents

- Tracking document information for guaranteed delivery

- Using common, secured communication protocols such as AS2

The Boomi Enterprise Platform adheres to EDI industry standards while providing flexibility for B2B processes to meet the needs of your company and trading partners.
