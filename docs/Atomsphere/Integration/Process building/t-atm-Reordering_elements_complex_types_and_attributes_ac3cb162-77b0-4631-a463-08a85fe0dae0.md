You can rearrange most elements, complex types, and attributes by dragging-and-dropping.

## Procedure

1.  Open an XML profile.

2.  On the **Data Elements** or **Types** tab, select an element, complex type or attribute.

3.  Drag it to a new location in the tree.

    Complex types on the **Types** tab cannot be moved.

    If the new location is valid, a yellow arrow icon, dashed line, and yellow highlighting appear at the location and you can drop it at this location.

    If the element, complex type or attribute can become a parent or child, a green plus sign ![icon](../Images/main-ic-plus-sign-green-on-white-16_17d4e20d-9f70-4eae-9661-36f7b7f056e8.jpg), dashed line, and yellow highlighting appear at the location and you can drop it at this location.

    If the new location is invalid, a red X ![icon](../Images/main-ic-x-red-stylized-16_5cfc1d0e-0ef7-44cc-bacf-4b4116afca79.jpg) appears â€” you cannot drop it at this location.

4.  Click **Save**.
