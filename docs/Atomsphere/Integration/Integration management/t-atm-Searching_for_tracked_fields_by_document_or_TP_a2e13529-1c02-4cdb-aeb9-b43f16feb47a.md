## About this task

Tracked fields are searchable in the Documents and Trading Partner views. The tracked field labels are prefaced with "User Defined".

1.  Go to the **Manage** menu's **Process Reporting** page.

2.  In the **Executions** list, click the drop-down arrow and select one of the following:

    -   **Documents**

    -   **Trading Partner**

3.  Click the **Past Hour** drop-down arrow, select the time frame in which the process was executed and click **Apply**.

4.  Click **Add Filter** and select a filter to refine your search. For example:

    -   Select the **Tracked Fields** filter, enter a tracked field’s value and click **Apply**.

    -   Select the **Tracked Fields** filter, select a tracked field’s name and click **Apply**.

    -   If you are viewing trading partner documents, you can also select the **From Trading Partner** or **To Trading Partner** filter, choose a trading partner and click **Apply**.

5.  Do one of the following:

    -   If you are viewing documents, select a document and click the document’s date/time link in the results table.

    -   If you are viewing trading partner documents, view the trading partner results table.

    Each field label for a tracked field appears as a column heading. The tracked field data appears in the new column for each operation containing a tracked value. A tracked field’s value is limited to 1000 characters, which you can see in this column.
