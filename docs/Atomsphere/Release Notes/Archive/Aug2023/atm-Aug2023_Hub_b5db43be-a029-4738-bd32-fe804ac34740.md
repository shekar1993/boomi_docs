**Features:**

-   After you restore a referenced end-dated golden record, Master Data Hub automatically resubmits data contributions that it quarantined due to Reference Unknown errors. You no longer need to resubmit a quarantined entity that references a restored record. \(HUB-1776\)

    To learn more about this feature, see [Restoring an end-dated golden record](../../Master%20Data%20Hub/Stewardship/t-mdm-Restoring_an_end-dated_golden_record_1b988891-3f6f-45f0-853f-bb6a3181b9cf.md).


**Fixes:**

-   Fixed an issue that caused Master Data Hub to incorrectly detect an update to float field values in a repeatable field group. This issue occurred when a batch did not contain field changes. \(HUB-1528\)
-   Icons no longer repeat and overlap when you import a profile to create model fields or add an integration as a data quality step. \(HUB-2455\)
