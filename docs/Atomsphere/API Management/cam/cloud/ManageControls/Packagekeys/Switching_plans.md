A Plan is a collection of services, endpoints, and methods that developers can access or make calls to. You can upgrade or downgrade the developer access to services on the Dashboard by switching the Plans for a Package key. 

## Procedure

To change a Plan for a Package key:

1. Click **Manage > Package Keys**. 

   The **Package Keys** page is displayed. 

2. On the **Package Keys** page, for a specific key, click ![](../../Images/edit.jpg). 

   The **Settings** page is displayed. 

3. In the Plan list, select a **plan**. 

   The list displays **Plans** under the Package with which the key is associated. 

4. Click **Save**. 

   :::note
   
   You cannot switch a Package Key to another Package. A Package Key can be associated with only one Plan.
