Assigning roles to users provide role-based access to resources in the API Control Center. Currently, an Organization has four roles - Administrator, API Manager, Community Manager, and Reports User. An Area Administrator and Organization Administrator can assign one or multiple roles to users. For example, a user can be assigned the Administrator of Heavy Industry and the API Manager of Medicine.
