The Magento connector makes it easy to work with the Magento eCommerce website software by simplifying the interaction and adding convenience.

## Connector configuration 

To configure a connector to communicate with Magento, set up two components:

-   Magento connection

-   Magento operation


This approach creates reusable connection settings components. After building your connection and connector operation, set up your connector within a process. When configure your connector with a process, can send data sets to the Magento application.

## Prerequisites 

To implement a connection to your Magento account, deploy an Atom on your local machine or is hosted with and have the following information:

-   Your Magento user name and password.

-   The store base URL.


## Supported editions and versions 

The Magento connector uses the Magento 1.x REST API to support application versions v2.1.1 and higher. The Magento 1.x REST API uses JSON format and manages profiles in JSON.

You can set up the Magento connector to move data into and out of any Magento platform \(Community Edition, Enterprise Edition, and Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition\) using Magento application versions v2.1.1 and later from any on-premise application and legacy system including other On Demand or SaaS-based applications.

## Tracked properties
