5.  In the **Add to** field, select the endpoints that you want to have generated.

6.  Click **Finish**.

    The wizard closes, the requested endpoints are generated, and the selected processes are linked to the corresponding new endpoints.

7.  In the API Service component, click **Save** or **Save and Close**.
