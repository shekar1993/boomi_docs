**We added this feature:**

- Improved Hl7 escape handling by allowing you to disable character escaping per profile, ensuring that string characters in elements are not escaped, regardless of whether the element is expanded. (B2B-4000)

  To learn more about this feature, refer to [Using enhanced composites](../../Integration/Process%20building/int-Using_enhanced_composites.md).
