The **Configure APIs and Application** \> **Deployed APIs** link in the API Management menu opens the Deployed APIs page, which is used to view and manage your APIs within API Management and provides quick links to edit the API or authentication method within Integration.

The Deployed APIs landing page allows you to view your Deployed APIs by Name, Gateway, or URL and provides the name, folder location, and description of the API Service/Proxy component. Clicking **Edit this API** opens a new window with the API Service/Proxy component open in Integration. APIs are searchable by API name or GUID, the environment, or API Gateway.

## APIs by Name tab 

The APIs by Name tab organizes your Deployed APIs by saved API component name and whether the API is an API Service component or an API Proxy component. All of the deployments for the specific API are grouped under collapsible or expandable sections.

:::info 

The API name is the most recently saved API component name, even if you have not deployed the API component since changing the name. Clicking **View** on a specific deployment includes the Published API Title from the last API deployment, even if that field was changed in the API component since the most recent deployment.

:::

The following information is provided for each deployed API.

**Details**
Click **View** to see the API Service/Proxy component details at to access the Swagger Visualization Portal for API components with REST endpoints.

:::info

The **Published API Title** field on the General tab uses the text from the last API component deployment, even if a more recent Published API Title exists in the API component.

:::

**Environment**
Shows the environment name from Integration to which the API Service/Proxy component is attached.

**Gateway**
Indicates the API Gateway. An API Proxy component must be deployed to an environment that is attachd to an API Gateway.

**API Version**
Shows the value specified in the API Service/Proxy component's **Published Version Number** field within Integration that is a user-specified value on the General tab.

**Authentication**
Specifies the authentication method for the API deployment. The API can use internal Atom-based authentication for deployed APIs that are on an environment without an API Gateway, API Key controlled authentication (for deployed APIs that are attached to an environment with an API Gateway), or an authentication provider. Click on the text in the Authentication field to set up an authentication provider.

**Plans**
Specifies the number of plans used with the API deployment. An API deployed on an API Gateway or an API that uses an authentication provider must have at least one plan associated with it. Click on the text in the Plans field to add a plan to the Deployed API.

**Custom URL?**
Specifies whether a base path of a deployed API on an API Gateway is customized. If a deployed API is deployed to an environment without an API Gateway or if the deployed API does not have any endpoints, you cannot specify a custom URL. If the field has **Yes** or **No** specified, click the text in the Custom URL field to modify the custom URL settings.

**Status**
Indicates whether the API can be reached on the API Gateway or the Atom or whether it requires additional configuration before it is operational.

For APIs that are deployed to an environment that contains an API Gateway, any API that indicates a “Requires Configuration” status will not be available on your Developer Portal until the configuration is complete. To complete the configuration, correct the indicated errors in the row. When the text in the Status column reads “Sent to the Gateway,” this deployed API is available on your Developer Portal.

## APIs by Gateway tab 

The APIs by Gateway tab organizes your Deployed APIs by API Gateway. All of the deployed APIs attached to an environment for the specific API Gateway are grouped under collapsible or expandable sections.

The following information is provided for each deployed API.

**Details**
Click **View** to see the API Service/Proxy component details at to access the Swagger Visualization Portal for API components with REST endpoints.

:::info 

The **Published API Title** field on the General tab uses the text from the last API component deployment, even if a more recent Published API Title exists in the API component.

:::

**API Name**
Indicates the name of your API Service/Proxy component and whether the API is an API Service component or an API Proxy component.

:::info 

The API name is the most recently saved API component name, even if you have not deployed the API component since changing the name. Clicking **View** on a specific deployment includes the Published API Title from the last API deployment, even if that field was changed in the API component since the most recent deployment.

:::

**Environment**
Shows the environment name (from Integration) to which the API Service/Proxy component is attached.

**API Version**
Shows the value specified in the API Service/Proxy component's **Published Version Number** field (within Integration) that is a user-specified value on the General tab.

**Authentication**
Specifies the authentication method for the API deployment. The API can use internal Atom-based authentication (for deployed APIs that are on an environment without an API Gateway), API Key controlled authentication (for deployed APIs that are attached to an environment with an API Gateway), or an authentication provider. Click on the text in the Authentication field to set up an authentication provider.

**Plans**
Specifies the number of plans used with the API deployment. An API deployed on an API Gateway or an API that uses an authentication provider must have at least one plan associated with it. Click on the text in the Plans field to add a plan to the Deployed API.

**Custom URL?**
Specifies whether a base path of a deployed API on an API Gateway is customized. If a deployed API is deployed to an environment without an API Gateway or if the deployed API does not have any endpoints, you cannot specify a custom URL. If the field has **Yes** or **No** specified, click the text in the Custom URL field to modify the custom URL settings.

**Status**
Indicates whether the API can be reached on the API Gateway or the Atom or whether it requires additional configuration before it is operational.

For APIs that are deployed to an environment that contains an API Gateway, any API that indicates a “Requires Configuration” status will not be available on your Developer Portal until the configuration is complete. To complete the configuration, correct the indicated errors in the row. When the text in the Status column reads “Sent to the Gateway,” this deployed API is available on your Developer Portal.

## APIs by URL tab 

The APIs by URL tab organizes your Deployed APIs by API Gateway and provides the specific URLs for each Base Path.

The following information is provided for each deployed API.

**Details**
Click **View** to see the API Service/Proxy component details at to access the Swagger Visualization Portal for API components with REST endpoints.

:::info

The **Published API Title** field on the General tab uses the text from the last API component deployment, even if a more recent Published API Title exists in the API component.

:::

**API Name**
Indicates the name of your API Service/Proxy component and whether the API is an API Service component or an API Proxy component.

:::tip 

The API name is the most recently saved API component name, even if you have not deployed the API component since changing the name. Clicking **View** on a specific deployment includes the Published API Title from the last API deployment, even if that field was changed in the API component since the most recent deployment.

:::

**Environment**
Shows the environment name (from Integration) to which the API Service/Proxy component is attached.

**Base URL Path as Configured**
Shows the web service URL, not including the endpoint name.

If the deployed API does not have any endpoints configured, a message notifying you of that displays in this field. Or, if there are conflicts in the API path, an error message displays notifying you of the conflict.

**Custom URL?**
Specifies whether a base path of a deployed API on an API Gateway is customized. If a deployed API is deployed to an environment without an API Gateway or if the deployed API does not have any endpoints, you cannot specify a custom URL. If the field has **Yes** or **No** specified, click the text in the Custom URL field to modify the custom URL settings.

**Status**
Indicates whether the API can be reached on the API Gateway or the Atom or whether it requires additional configuration before it is operational.
