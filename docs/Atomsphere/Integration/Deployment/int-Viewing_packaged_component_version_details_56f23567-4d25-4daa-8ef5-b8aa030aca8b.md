Use the Packaged Components page to view detailed information about a specific version of a packaged component.

## About this task

From the Packaged Components Details page, you can perform various actions such as viewing details about a specific version of the packaged component, viewing a list child components included with the primary component, determining if the packaged component was deployed and to which environment it was deployed to, and finally if the version was shared within the process library or an integration pack.

## Procedure

1. From the list on the Packaged Component page \(**Deploy** \> **Packaged Component**\), locate a packaged component whose details you want to view.

2. In the same row as the packaged component, click the **Action** ![img-int-black_gear](../Images/main-ic-gear-black-16_cdde83e4-a176-436a-86ca-1fe4937e3085.jpg) menu icon and select **Packaged Component Details** from the list of options.

    The Packaged Component Details dialog appears and displays information about the selected version of the packaged component.
