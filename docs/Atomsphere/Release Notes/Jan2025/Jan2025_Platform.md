**We added these features:**

- Role-related audit logs now include the `ROLE_NAME` for improved readability. (PS-5601)

- An audit log record will be created every time the `ROLE_NAME` is modified. (PS-5599)

- Added the following enhancements to XML, JSON, Database, EDI, and Flat File profiles:

  - You can search for specific profile elements by using the search bar in the elements panel (UU-6135, UU-8110, UU-8554, UU-8555, UU-8556)

  - You can expand or collapse all child elements by clicking the arrow next to the element name (UU-6137, UU-7879, UU-8552, UU-8553)

  - Adding an identifier to an element no longer collapses the profile tree (UU-6138, UU-9516)

- You can rearrange open tabs on the Build canvas by dragging and dropping them. When you drag a tab toward the last visible tab, the tabs bar scrolls to show the next open tab. After you have rearranged the tabs, the **All** drop-down updates with the new order of the tabs. (UU-6209, UU-6230, UU-6229)

- While rearranging a tab, it is highlighted blue to indicate that it is being moved. (UU-6281)
