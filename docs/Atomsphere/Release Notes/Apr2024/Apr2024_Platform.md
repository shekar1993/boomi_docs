**Important information for the upcoming audit log retention changes**

As part of continuously strengthening Boomiâ€™s security posture, we are revamping how long we store customer [audit logs](https://developer.boomi.com/api/platformapi#tag/AuditLog) from indefinite retention towards the industry standard practice of 1-year retention. This policy applies to all Boomi products including Integration, Event Streams, EDI Management, API Management, Master Data Hub, and Flow. While initially slated for April 2024, we've decided to extend the deadline to allow ample time for preparation and downloading of older logs. Stay tuned for the announcement of the new deadline, which will be communicated via the community article below and future release notes. Read [Audit Log Retention Changes for all Boomi Customers](https://community.boomi.com/s/article/Audit-Log-Retention-Changes-for-all-Boomi-Customers) for more information. 

**We added these features:**
