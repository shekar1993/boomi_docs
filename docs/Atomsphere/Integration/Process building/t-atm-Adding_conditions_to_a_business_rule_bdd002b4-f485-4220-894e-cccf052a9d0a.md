Once you define the inputs for a business rule, you can add its conditions.

1.  In the Business Rules step dialog, define input fields and/or functions.

2.  Select a top-level operator by clicking **AND** or **OR**.

3.  Click **Add a condition**.

4.  Select a static value, a single field output or a single function output, then select an operator. Select a second static value, a single field output or a single function output.

When creating a condition, you have the ability to choose Static on either side of the equation and enter a hard-coded value in the next field. The output results are available in a drop-down list as well. The list includes the name of each field or function that you defined. In the event that there are multiple outputs from a function-type input, you can choose one output per condition. Each function output is listed separately.

5.  Click **Save**.

6.  Repeat steps 3-5 to add another condition.

7.  To add nested conditions, click **Add a group**.

8.  Select a group operator.

9.  Repeat steps 3-5 to add a condition to the group.

10. Repeat the steps for adding conditions and groups as needed.

11. Now you can add error messages.
