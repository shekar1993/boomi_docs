Adding a condition group(s) is an optional part of the process of adding a tag.


## Procedure

1.  In the Conditions section of the dialog used to add a tag, point in the desired level in the conditions hierarchy and click **Add a Group**.

    ![Click Add a Group as opposed to Add a Condition.](../Images/Models/main-ds-business-rule-add-condition-condition-group_6d39ea0e-60ca-49d1-a2b7-31ab6336d226.jpg)

    Links and controls for defining a condition group appear at the pointer location.

    ![Select the Boolean operator, either AND (the default) or OR.](../Images/Common/mdm-ds-add-rule-expression-group_a09509f2-28f8-4eab-9e76-afb145086ac9.jpg)

2.  In the **Group Level Operator** list, select the Boolean operator that will relate the conditions to be grouped â€” AND \(the default operator\) or OR.

3.  Click the adjacent **Save** button \(not the Save button at the bottom of the dialog\).

    Parentheses delimiting the newly defined condition group are shown. When you pause the pointer on the top delimiter, links appear enabling you to edit or remove the condition group.
