Deploy packaged components to a runtime environment from the Packaged Components page \(**Deploy** \> **Packaged Components**\) or the Deployments page \(**Deploy** \> **Deployments**\).

**Deployment** is the means by which you move your completed processes and components from development into a Test or Production environment \(also known as a runtime environment\).

In order to deploy a component or process, you must first create a packaged component version for it (in other words, you create a snapshot of the component's finished state). A packaged component is given a consistent version number that can be deployed across different environments. To read more about Packaged Components and to learn how to create them, see the Related Links section.

After you first build and package the deployable component, you can then proceed with the deployment process by assigning it to a runtime environment. You can deploy a package from:

- The [Packaged Components page](int-Deploying_packaged_components_from_packaged_components_page_dca7f927-8522-4c8e-a65f-3bc598254b74.md) from the Actions menu ![img-int-black_gear](../Images/main-ic-gear-black-16_cdde83e4-a176-436a-86ca-1fe4937e3085.jpg) of a specific packaged component

- The [Packaged Components page](int-Creating_and_deploying_packaged_components_from_packaged_components_page_3855b89b-8118-446f-87cc-859c163403d2.md) at the completion of the Create Packaged Components wizard

- The [Deployments page](int-Deploying_packaged_components_from_deployments_page_6b45230f-dab2-4c10-bdba-2f0761d589c3.md) using the Deploy Packaged Components wizard
