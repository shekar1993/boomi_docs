On the **Organization API Definitions** page, the Organization Administrator and the API Manager can set the API Control Center visibility of the APIs. The API Definitions in the Organization are made visible (read-only) to other Organizations. Hence, the users in the other Organizations can view the API Definitions for various business requirements. To know more about API Definitions, see [API Definitions](../../../../DesignControls/APIdefinitions/API_definitions.md) and [API Definition & Endpoint List](../../../../DesignControls/APIdefinitions/Endpoints/Endpoints.md).
