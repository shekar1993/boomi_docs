## Boomi Messages

A Message is a single Boomi document that flows through the platform, involving any of the components: Integration, Flow, APIM, Hub, and EDI.

Messages include each inbound and outbound document that you send or receive, regardless of the format or transport method. For example, if you send an XML file over FTP and receive a binary file over HTTP, you have used two Messages.

Messages also include the response documents from request/response outbound interactions.

Internal component-to-component messages within the same account, such as Integration calling Flow, are not counted as Messages.
