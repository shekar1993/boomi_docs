Add containers to a page to form the page structure, and group components together.

## Overview

Containers act as placeholders for content in a page. You can combine multiple containers in a page to build the exact page layout that you require. Add components into containers to define the actual content displayed on the page.

-   All content on a page is contained within a "main" parent container.

-   Choose how a container and it's contents are displayed on a page by changing the container layout type. For example, containers can display content on a page in horizontal rows, or as columns. See [Container layout types](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/flo-pages-containers-types_dbb2755d-f33a-4b21-b034-3c11f9f5fde0.md).

-   You can nest containers within other containers, which can also contain any mix of containers and components. This allows you to build complex page layouts by combining multiple container types and components.

-   Customize the appearance and behavior of containers using attributes and custom CSS styling. See [Attributes reference](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/r-flo-Attributes_Reference_4f153424-8c52-4e24-b289-2d961f0b9830.md) and [CSS reference](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/r-flo-CSS_Reference_d32122b8-0f11-47be-91c6-6986575f933e.md). Containers render as `<DIV>` elements when published in a flow web application.
