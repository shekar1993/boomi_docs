Although Integration does not provide an in-browser step-by-step debugging facility for scripting, there are several options available. With a little practice, those familiar with programming and processing can often debug scripts by simply running the process, inspecting the resulting data and working through any runtime exceptions.

However for more complex scripts, with a little effort you can use an external development environment or testing console to completely debug your script step by step. Once satisfied you can copy the script back into the custom scripting step or update the appropriate Scripting component. Be sure to remove any extra debugging code you may have added and incorporate the `dataContext` interaction.

Here are a few tips to keep in mind when writing scripts:

-   Remember to use the `==` operator when *comparing* two values; use the `=` operator when *assigning* a value to a variable.

-   When comparing multiple expressions, use the `&&` \("AND"\) operator if *all* expressions must be true; use the `||` \("OR"\) operator if *any* of the expressions can be true.
