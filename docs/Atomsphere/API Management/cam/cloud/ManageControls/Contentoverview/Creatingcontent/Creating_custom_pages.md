Custom pages can be added and published on the Portal. After adding a page, you can set the page title, page content, CSS, JavaScript, and page visibility. 

## Procedure

To create a custom page: 

1. On the **Content** page, click **New Item**. 

   A popup menu opens with the following type of page options. 

   - Custom Page

   - Documentation Page 

   - Blog Post 
   
2. Click **Custom Page**.

   A page is added to the **Custom Pages** folder in Draft mode. 

3. Enter the page title in the **Page Title** field. 

4. In the **Body** section, enter the text. Using the editor, you can format the text. For more information about the editor, see [WYSIWYG Editor](../WYSIWYGeditor/WYSIWYG_editor.md). 

5. Click the page mode drop-down list and select Publish to publish the page on the Portal.

   The users cannot view pages on the Portal that are in **Draft** mode. When a published page is switched to **Draft** mode, it is no longer public.

6. Click **Save**. 

   The page is saved and published on the Portal. 

   The following are the rules for organizing pages and folders in CMS under the **Custom Pages** section:

   - The default page cannot be deleted. 
   
   - Folder name cannot be changed after it is saved. 
   
   - A new folder cannot be created with the name of an existing page. 
   
   - Pages with same page title can exist in different folders. 
   
   - A page cannot be moved from one folder to another folder. 
   
   - Page sequence can be changed by dragging the file to the new location.
