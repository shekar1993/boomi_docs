Customizing your default Developer Portal experience is one of the most important activities in your portal development process, and the specific approaches are described in [Advanced Customizations for your Developer Portal](../Advanced_customizations_devportal/Advanced_customizations_for_your_developer_portal.md). Once you've developed some [translations](../Advanced_customizations_devportal/Translations/Translations2.md), [template customizations](../Advanced_customizations_devportal/Modify_templates_and_layouts/Modifying_templates_and_layouts.md) or you need to provide file assets for consumption by your markup, you have a mechanism inside your cluster by which to import those customizations into your test cluster. 

This section covers: 

- [Phase: Design and Development](../Deploy_default_portal_customizations_and_assets_to_clusters/Phase_Design_and_Development/Phase_design_and_development.md)

- [Phase: Production](../Deploy_default_portal_customizations_and_assets_to_clusters/Phase_production.md)
