# Previewing a page

<head>
  <meta name="guidename" content="Flow"/>
  <meta name="context" content="GUID-7d23016c-11e5-4a45-a949-c29db9372737"/>
</head>


Preview what your page structure will look like in a browser without having to generate and run the flow. The preview does not apply any CSS styling, but simply provides a skeletal framework view of the page layout.

1.  Click either the **Preview mobile** or **Preview desktop** icon in the page header.

2.  Once you have finished previewing the page, click the icon again to return to the build view.
