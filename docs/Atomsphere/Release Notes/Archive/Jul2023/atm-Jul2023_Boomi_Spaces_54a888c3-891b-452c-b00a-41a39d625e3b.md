We are thrilled to share that Boomi Labs, our new hub designed for Boomi builders, is now available for all Boomi users. Boomi Labs is a centralized collection of tools for users to easily create, share, publish, and manage their Boomi assets. It makes it easier and faster for our builders to find what they need so that they can focus on their tasks.

## Spaces 

Within Boomi Labs, Boomi is introducing Spaces. Spaces revolutionizes integration management by allowing users to create and share collections of Integration Packs in a separate, dedicated portal. With Spaces, portal end users gain the ability to effortlessly install, configure, schedule, and execute integration processes.
