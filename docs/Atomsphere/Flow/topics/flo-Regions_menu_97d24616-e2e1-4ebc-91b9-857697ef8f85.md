## Changing region 

To change to a different region:

1.  Open the **Regions** menu.
2.  Choose the region you want to change to. See [Flow regions](flo-Regions_1a50f08b-dfa3-49fb-ab92-27580c046354.md).
3.  You are redirected to the new region. The browser URL changes to the regional URL that you have switched to.

    -  If you do not already have an existing user account set up in this region, you are prompted to create a new tenant for the region using your user account.

    -   If you already have an existing tenant for your user account in this region, you are automatically signed in to the new region.
  
4.  Once you are signed in to the new region, you can create tenants, users, and flows as normal.

   To assist with moving your existing settings and flows to a different region, you can migrate tenant content from one region to another using the tenant data export and import functionality. See [Exporting and importing tenant data](flo-tenant_export_import_8f733b18-2d03-4695-bcff-70d0280874b0.md).
