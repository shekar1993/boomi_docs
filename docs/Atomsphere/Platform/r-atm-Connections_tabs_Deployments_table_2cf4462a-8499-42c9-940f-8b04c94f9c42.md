The Deployments table shows all instances of a connection deployed per process and per Atom.

If you select a connector class from the Connections by Class table, the Deployments table shows only the connections for the selected class. Then, if you select a connector type from the Connectors Deployed in Class table, the Deployments table shows only the connections for the selected class and type.

A connection may be listed several times in the Deployments table. The list is for informational purposes only and does not reflect the actual billable connection count. It is simply a view of all connections per process and per Atom (and optionally per connector class and connector type as well).
