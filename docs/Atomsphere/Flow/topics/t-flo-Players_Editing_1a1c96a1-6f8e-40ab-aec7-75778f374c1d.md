You can edit your custom players from the **Players** page.

1.  Navigate to the **Players** page.
   
2.  Select the player you wish to edit from the **Player selection** drop-down menu.
3.  The code for the player is displayed in the main window and can be edited directly.
4.  Once you have modified the code as required, click **Save** to save your changes to the player.

You can quickly preview how your flows will look with the player applied. See [Previewing a player](t-flo-Players_Previewing_df24e41d-01af-43f5-8031-fc86362c39e2.md).
