This topic describes how to configure the local runtime Docker image for setting up a local runtime.

## Before you begin

- Ensure that you have downloaded the Flow Docker image.

- Ensure that you have copied and have access to the local runtime token created when [Creating a local runtime connection in Boomi Flow](c-flo-MC_Creating_Local_Runtime_in_Flow_9569e2be-f4fe-4284-9559-58b5b9036b52.md).

## Setting up the Docker local runtime

- To set up a local runtime, one or more local runtime nodes will need to be started.

- The runtime nodes must be able to access a PostgreSQL database, using a user with permission to create, modify and drop tables in the specified database and schema.

- The runtime nodes must be able to access the following URLs:

  -   https://flow.boomi.com
  -   https://runtimes.flow.boomi.com

- The runtime nodes do not need to be publicly accessible to the internet. Flow will never try to connect to them via an inbound connection.

- The local runtime token must be provided in the `INSTALLATION_TOKEN` environment setting.

- If you are using regions in combination with a local runtime, the optional `FLOW_API_URL` setting must be provided, with the appropriate matching regional URL. See [Flow regions](flo-Regions_1a50f08b-dfa3-49fb-ab92-27580c046354.md).

## Example Docker Compose YAML

The following example docker-compose.yml illustrates how to use Docker Compose to run a base configuration of the local runtime node and database services. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications; with Docker Compose, a YAML file is used to configure your applicationâ€™s services.

To learn more about Docker Compose, see the official [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) documentation.

::caution

This example is not suitable for a production deployment, as the database is not persistent and there is only one runtime node, but it is provided to show the minimum required configuration. Users should consult with their appropriate System Administrator for a production-like deployment environment (for example utilizing a High-availability database, multiple runtime nodes behind a load balancer, and so on.)

#This example Docker Compose file uses the latest Postgres, Boomi Flow to run a local runtime within a testing environment. 
#This does not include a web server. Players should be placed as .html files on the webserver or embedded in the content managment system. To learn more about embedding players, see /csh?context=GUID-8145909a-9fec-40f2-a4a4-4e305f06b1a4.

## Runtime service environment - general settings

| Setting             | Required? | Description |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|
| BASE_URL         | ![Required](../Images/img-flo-Icon_Tick_d235399f-31a8-4464-a9c7-984432116e77.png) Required | The base URL of the API, used when generating absolute URLs, such as OAuth 2.0 redirect URIs and callback URIs for services. <br /><br />For example: <br />`BASE_URL=https://flow.yourcompany.com:8080/subdirectory`<br /><br />For example, if the port that the container is being exposed on is set to '1234:80' in the docker compose file, this would be: <br />`BASE_URL=https://localhost:1234` |
| INSTALLATION_TOKEN| ![Required](../Images/img-flo-Icon_Tick_d235399f-31a8-4464-a9c7-984432116e77.png) Required | The unique local runtime token used to install a runtime. This value is obtained during the process of [Creating a local runtime connection in Boomi Flow](c-flo-MC_Creating_Local_Runtime_in_Flow_9569e2be-f4fe-4284-9559-58b5b9036b52.md). <br /><br />For example: <br />`INSTALLATION_TOKEN=mfZXe7RPbnc0iEu9eoud6X+ZQjneuui=` |
| FLOW_API_URL      | ![Optional](../Images/img-flo-Icon_Cross_b07fedc0-b847-48db-9354-e864a2e4c221.png) Optional | If you are using a different region to the main US region, specify the alternative cloud platform regional URL.<br /><br />For example, if you are using the Europe \(EU\) region: <br />`FLOW_API_URL=https://eu.flow-prod.boomi.com`<br /><br />If this optional setting is not included in the docker file, it defaults to `https://flow.boomi.com`. <br /><br />To learn more about using regions, and to see a list of regional URLs, see [Regions](flo-Regions_1a50f08b-dfa3-49fb-ab92-27580c046354.md). |
| FLOW_OFFLINE      | ![Optional](../Images/img-flo-Icon_Cross_b07fedc0-b847-48db-9354-e864a2e4c221.png) Optional | Starts the runtime up in an 'offline' mode. This means that no network communication is attempted with the cloud platform. This setting is useful if your runtime has already been installed online and has flows deployed, but you wish to move it to an internal network or a location with poor external connectivity. This setting allows the runtime to operate 'offline', and run the flows that have already been deployed to it. <br /><br />For example, you may have connectivity to the cloud platform in your test environment, but require an 'offline' mode in your production environment as it requires/has no connectivity to the cloud platform. <br /><br />- Set to 'true' to start up the runtime in 'offline' mode, i.e. no network communication is attempted with the cloud platform. <br />- Set to 'false' or leave unspecified to start the runtime in normal 'online' mode, i.e. it will initially connect to the cloud platform. This is the default mode. <br /><br />For example: <br />`FLOW_OFFLINE=true` |
