To create a Space, you must select an Account group to manage the user and account access to the Space. Each Space can be associated only with one account group, and you cannot modify the association after the Space creation.

:::note

You can create multiple Spaces and account groups, even with the same accounts and users.

:::

To create a Space:

1. On the top menu bar of the Boomi Enterprise Platform, navigate to **Labs** &gt; **Spaces.**
2. On the **Spaces** page, click **Create Space**.

:::note

 If all the existing groups are already associated with a Space, a pop-up displays as `No Account Groups Available!`. Click the link in the pop-up to [Create a New Account Group](https://qa.boomi.com/AtomSphere.html#settings;type=accountgroup)**.** To learn more about creating an account group, read [adding an Account Group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wTX07KMwN-qf_exERTQF0B0CoJLxo_b9PLBPLytf3Mw/edit?pli=1#heading=h.88792ai3waat).

:::

3. Type a **Space Name** and select an **Account Group** for the new Space.
4. Click **Create** to finish creating the Space.
5. Click **Done**

    Space is created successfully, and by default, it opens the **Space Information** page.
