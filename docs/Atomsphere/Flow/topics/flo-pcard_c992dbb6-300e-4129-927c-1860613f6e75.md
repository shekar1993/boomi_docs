Payment Card component displays customised input fields for payment card data.

## Overview 

Displays a preformatted set of input fields for accepting, validating, and formatting payment card data.

The data must be stored in a value using the dedicated $Payment Card system type. See [System Types](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/r-flo-Types_System_d5418044-1ac0-4d01-9485-5ebd06ab7f8e.md).

The component provides the following input field:

|Field|Description|
|:----|:----------|
|Card number|This field only accepts numeric values, up to a maximum of nineteen digits.|
|Expiry date|This field only accepts numeric values. Input is shown as a single field in MM/YY format, but data is stored as separate MM and YYYY values. Two digit year input is converted to a four digit year in the current century, for example, "22" is stored as "2022".|
|Security code|This field only accepts numeric values, up to a maximum of 4 digits.|
|Name on card|This field accepts any number of characters. Values are automatically converted to upper case.|
|Postal code|This field accepts a maximum of 9 characters. Values are automatically converted to upper case.|


:::note

This component is not supported by the default legacy player runtime.

## General Settings 

| Setting | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| **Name** | Enter a name for the component. |
| **Label** | Enter a label for the component. The label is displayed above the component by default. Do not enter a label if you do not require this text to be shown. |
| **Editable** | Specify if the component can accept user input. <ul><li>Select the checkbox to allow the component to accept input from a user.</li><li>De-select the checkbox to prevent a user from being able to input or interact with the component.</li></ul> |
| **Help information about this component** | Display help text directly below the component, for example to provide further information on how to use the component. |


## State 

Select the value that you wish to save the payment card data into.

-   **Save the component state into**: Click **Select or create a new value** to select an existing value or create a new value.

Values should use the 'Payment Card' system type. See [System Types](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/r-flo-Types_System_d5418044-1ac0-4d01-9485-5ebd06ab7f8e.md).

## Validation

Add client-side page validation to the component.

-   Switch on the **Required** toggle.

| Setting | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| **Required** | Specify if the component requires user input before the next map element in the flow can be navigated to. For example, a user must complete the input for this field before they are allowed to progress in the flow. <ul><li>Switch on the toggle to set the component as requiring input from a user before they can progress in the flow, such as to the next page for example. A red asterisk is displayed next to the field name to indicate it is required.</li><li>Switch off the toggle to allow a user to progress in the flow even if they have not entered any input into the component, for example if the field is optional.</li></ul> |


There are certain validation rules that are used depending on the payment issuers. The validation policies that differ according to the identified payment issuers are shown in the table below:

| **Card** | **Length of the Card number** | **Length of the Security code** |
|----|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Mastercard | 16 | 3 |
| Visa | 16 | 3 |
| American express | 15 | 4 |
| Unknown | 1-19 | 3-4 |


The table below lists the validation rules that do not change based on the detected issuer.

|Field|Length|
|-----|------|
|Name on card|1-Unlimited|
|Expiry date|4 \(two digits for month, two for year\)|
|Postal code|1-Unlimited|

## Supported Card Issuers 

When you enter a card number, the component looks up the Issuer Identification Number (IIN) ranges for each issuers and compares the first few digits of the number to those ranges to identify the issuers. The component utilises the issuers-specific validation ruleset to validate the input and displays the name of the found issuers inside the card number field.

The list of payment issuers accepted by the Payment Card component, together with the IIN ranges it uses to identify them, may be found in the table below.

|Card Issuer|IIN range\(s\)|
|-----------|--------------|
|Mastercard|51-55, 2221-2702|
|Visa|4|
|American Express|34, 37|

If the component cannot detect the issuer, it displays the issuer as `Unknown` and applies only loose validation. See the [Validation](#validation) for more information.

## Styles 

Apply additional CSS styling to the component.

1.  Enter space-delimited CSS classes/selectors into the **CSS Classes** field.

When you run the flow, these classes are appended to the main component class. See [CSS reference](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/r-flo-CSS_Reference_d32122b8-0f11-47be-91c6-6986575f933e.md).
