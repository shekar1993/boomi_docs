You can view document error details in Process Reporting.

## Before you begin

You must have the View Data privilege to view document error details. If you have only the View Results privilege, you cannot perform the task.

## Procedure

1.  In the **Manage** menuâ€™s **Process Reporting** page, find the execution during which the error occurred.

2.  Click the date/time link for that execution to go to the execution detail view.

    The **Documents with Errors** list contains entries for documents with errors processed during the execution.

3.  Do one of the following:

    -   To view error details for the first document in the **Documents With Errors** list, click the truncated Error Message for the document either in the list or immediately above the connections list.

    -   To view error details for any other document in the **Documents With Errors** list, click the truncated Error Message for the document in the list.

    The Document Error detail view opens. The full error message is shown immediately below the list heading.
