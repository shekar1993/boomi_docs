Use basic page conditions to change the state of a component in a page layout, based on the value of another component.

## Overview

Basic page conditions allow you to quickly set up a simple page condition that does not require any complex logic. [Complex page conditions](flo-Conditions_complex_71527fb2-50fe-4f6f-bfbc-8eb40597f2b5.md) allow you to set up more complex page conditions.

Basic page conditions only allow you to change the following page component attributes:

-   **Visibility**: Whether a component is visible on the page when rendered in a browser/user interface.

-   **Required**: Whether a component must be completed by a user before they can proceed in a flow. For example, an input field on a page can be set as required, and must be completed before the user can navigate away from the page.

-   **Enabled**: Whether a component is displayed as normal and enabled, or disabled/greyed out so that the user cannot interact with the component when it is rendered on a page. For example, a component may be set as disabled initially, and only enabled once a user selects a particular option from another page component.
