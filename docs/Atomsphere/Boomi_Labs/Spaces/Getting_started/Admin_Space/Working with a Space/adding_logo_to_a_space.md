# Adding logo to a Space

Incorporating a logo into a Space reinforces your brand identity and creates a cohesive user experience. 

During the Space creation process, admins can upload a logo, which will be visible to all users within that specific Space. Once uploaded, the logo will be displayed in the top-left corner of the Spaceâ€™s portal interface. This logo is specific to the Space and will not appear in other interfaces or Spaces within the Boomi platform, ensuring each Space maintains its distinct identity. Any user, including those from child or sub-accounts, who logs into the Space will see the uploaded logo, ensuring a consistent brand experience for all users.

To add a logo to a Space:

1. On the **Spaces** page, click on the name of your Space. The **Space Information** page opens.

2. Under the **Site Logo** option, click the **Choose a File** button.

    This action opens a window for you to select a logo file from your local computer.

3. Select a file and click **Open** to upload the logo.

:::note

The logo must not be larger than 256KB and should be in .jpg, .png, or .svg format. After you upload the logo, you can view the logo under the Site Logo Preview option.

:::

4. Optional: To add alternative text for the logo, type the text in the **Site Logo Alternative Text** field.

5. Click **Save** to finish uploading the logo to the Space.

To remove the logo, Click **Delete** under the Site Logo Preview option and Click **Save**.
