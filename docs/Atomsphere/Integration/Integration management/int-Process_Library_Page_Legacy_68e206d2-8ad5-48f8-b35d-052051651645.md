Selecting **Manage** \> **Process Library** opens the Process Library page.

The page consists of the following areas:

-   Publishable Components list — A list of processes and API Service components that are available for publishing.

    At the top of the list there is a filter icon ![Filter icon](../Images/main-ic-filter-gray_b6006570-dfb3-4bfc-8e9a-cf62c21b223a.jpg) and a search box. You can search for components to publish by using one of the preset filters or by typing all or part of a component name. The available preset filters are:

    -   Component Type — Process and API Service

    -   Status — Unpublished, Published, and Published with Changes
