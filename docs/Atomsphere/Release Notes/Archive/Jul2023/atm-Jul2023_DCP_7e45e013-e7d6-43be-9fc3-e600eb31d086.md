Data Catalog and Preparation features and fixes are not in the Runtime Release.

**Features:**

-   DCP now supports incremental data capture for Salesforce data sets. Incremental data capture allows you to process only the changes to the data set. When scheduling jobs, you can select which column from the data set to use as a unique identifier in the IDC drop-down menu. \(DCP-1734\)

**Fixes**:

-   An issue prevented you from loading sample data for a BigQuery dataset in the Data Set Explorer. With this fix, the BigQuery JDBC driver was updated to successfully load sample data. \(DCP-1787\)
-   When transferring ownership of objects to another user, the Datastore Adapter section did not display a list of owned adapters. With this fix, all adapters owned by the transferring user display in the Transfer Ownership dialog box. \(DCP-1781\)
