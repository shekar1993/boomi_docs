Add a single or multi-installation integration pack on the **Deploy** \> **Integration Packs** page as the first step in creating integration packs.

1. In the Integration Packs page \(**Manage** \> **Integration Packs**\), click **![](../Images/main-ic-plus-sign-green-on-white-blue-outline-16_3d421ea7-ef6b-4b9f-8c4b-1667db6191f5.jpg) Add Integration Pack**.

2. In the **Integration Pack Name** field, type a name for the integration pack.

3. In the **Integration Pack Type** list, select either:

    - Single Attachment — Only one instance of the integration pack can be installed per account.

    - Multiple Attachments — Multiple instances of the integration pack can be installed per account.

    Once an integration pack is added, you cannot change its type.

    This list is present only if the multi-install integration packs feature is enabled in the account. If you would like to have this feature enabled, contact your Sales Representative. If this feature is not enabled, you can add only Single Attachment integration packs.

    :::note
    
    Multi-install integration packs cannot include API Service components.

    ::

4. In the description field, type a description of the integration pack.

    The description can contain up to 500 characters.

5. Click **Save**.

    The integration pack type confirmation dialog is displayed.

6. In the confirmation dialog, click **OK**.

    The name of the newly added integration pack appears in the Integration Packs list.

After you add an integration pack you need to add some combination of published processes and API Service components to the integration pack.
