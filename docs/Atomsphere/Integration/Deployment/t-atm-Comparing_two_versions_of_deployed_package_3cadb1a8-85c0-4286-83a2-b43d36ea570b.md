On the **Deployments** page, use the **Compare Deployed Package** action to compare two versions of a deployed package.

This following can help you determine why you might view another version of a package:

- To identify differences for the purpose of troubleshooting
- To decide if you want to deploy a newer version of the package or redeploy an older version of the package

1. On the **Deployments** page, click the **![](../Images/main-ic-gear-black-16_cdde83e4-a176-436a-86ca-1fe4937e3085.jpg) Actions** menu for a deployed package and select **Compare Deployed Package**.

    The Compare Deployed Package dialog opens with the selected version in the **Selected Package Version** field.
