The Package Keys can be enabled or disabled on the **Package Keys** page. The purpose of enabling or disabling the Package Keys is to control specific developer access to APIs without modifying the Plans and affecting other users.

Enabling allows API traffic through and the calls are managed by the Traffic Manager according to the rules defined in the associated Plan.
