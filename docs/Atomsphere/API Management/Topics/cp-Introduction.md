## Federated API Management

The API Control Plane is a Federated API Management platform that can provision, discover, and secure all of your APIs in one central place. It is designed to streamline your API management processes across various environments and platforms, effectively bridging the gap between disparate API systems and bringing an end to API sprawl. This allows a vendor-agnostic administration of the entire API lifecycle and can be adapted to the requirements of your organization. The Boomi API Control Plane takes the complexity out of API management with our unified API registry, enabling a coherent CX and consistent governance across all APIs.

In an era where digital connections and seamless data exchanges are critical, APIs stand as fundamental elements linking various software applications, systems, and services. The challenge lies in managing these elements effectively, particularly as organizations expand and their API networks grow in scale and complexity. The API Control Plane is tailored to meet these challenges head-on, offering a solution that harmonizes API management with the evolving demands of a modern digital enterprise.

Central to this platform is the concept of streamlined operations and integration. It enhances the overall efficiency of your organization's operations, contributing to a more agile, innovative, and customer-centric business model, and gives you the ability to deploy, manage, and scale APIs rapidly. Security and governance form the backbone of the API Control Plane.
