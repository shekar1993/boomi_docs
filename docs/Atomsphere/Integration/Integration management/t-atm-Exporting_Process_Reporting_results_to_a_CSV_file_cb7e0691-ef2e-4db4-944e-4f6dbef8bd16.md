    -   If your browser is set to ask for a location when downloading, you are prompted for a destination folder and file name.

    -   If your browser is set to not ask, the results are exported to your default location as a CSV file with the appropriate file name:

        -   executions\_\<accountId\>\_\<timeStamp\>.csv

        -   documents\_\<accountId\>\_\<timeStamp\>.csv
