To request access to an API, you must find the appropriate API and Subscribe to it so that you can use it in one or more of your applications. Requesting subscriptions of disabled applications is not allowed.

## Before you begin

[Register an Application](/docs/Atomsphere/API%20Management/Topics/api-Registering_an_Application_862c867b-2368-4747-b79b-40b7be0b865b.md).

## Procedure

1.  From the Developer Portal, click **API Catalog**.

2.  From the available APIs, click on the API name that you want to view.

    Type your search string in the **Search APIs by name** field to more quickly navigate to your intended API.

    The Overview and endpoint information for that API displays.

3.  Click **Subscribe** if the API is the one that you want to request access to.

    Otherwise, click **API Catalog** to return to the list of available APIs.

4.  After clicking Subscribe, select an enabled Application from the drop-down menu and optionally provide a message to the API owner.

    A “Subscription Request Received” message appears. Click **Close**.
