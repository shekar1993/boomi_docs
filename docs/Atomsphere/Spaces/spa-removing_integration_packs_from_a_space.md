You can remove integration packs from a Space if you no longer want to share them with the user of the Space.

:::note

When you remove an integration pack from a Space, it also removes the ipack from the account group associated with the Space.

To remove an integration pack from a Space:

1. On the **Spaces** page, click on the name of the Space from which you want to remove an integration pack.

    The **Space Information** page opens.

2. On the left pane of the Space Information page, navigate to the **Integration Packs**.

    The Integration Packs page displays all integration packs already added to the Space.

3. Select the integration pack that you want to remove and click **Remove**.
