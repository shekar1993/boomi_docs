The Boomi AtomSphere API connector enables you to perform the object-based operations and actions exposed in the AtomSphere API.

The Boomi AtomSphere API connector is designed to connect seamlessly with Boomi Integration, which consists of web service calls utilizing SOAP request and response setup over an HTTPS connection. The technical details of this connection, such as request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection, are all abstracted to simplify your implementation.
