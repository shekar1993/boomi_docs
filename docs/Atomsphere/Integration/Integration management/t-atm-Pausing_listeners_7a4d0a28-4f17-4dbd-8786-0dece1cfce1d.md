You can pause all or selected listeners.

## Before you begin

You must have the Atom Management privilege to perform this task. If you have the Atom Management Read Access privilege, you cannot perform the task.

## Procedure


1.  Go to **Manage** \> **Atom Management**.

2.  Select the Atom, Molecule, or Atom Cloud from the list on the left.

3.  Select the **Listeners** panel.

    The list of listeners that are deployed to the selected Atom, Molecule, or Atom Cloud is displayed.

4. **Optional:** To filter the list, do one of the following:

    -   Click ![Filter](../Images/main-ic-filter-gray_b6006570-dfb3-4bfc-8e9a-cf62c21b223a.jpg) and select a preset filter — **Listening** or **Errored**.
    -   In the **Filter listeners by name** field, type all or part of a listener name.
5. **Optional:** To select specific listeners, select the check box for each listener that you want to pause.

    You can simultaneously toggle the check boxes for all listeners of a given connector type by toggling the check box for the connector type grouping — for example, Web Services Server.

6.  Click **Pause** above the list, and in the drop-down list select one of the following:

    -   **All Listeners**
    -   **Selected Listeners** \(if you selected listeners in step 5\)  
    
    :::note
    
    As an alternative, you can click ![Gear or Action icon](../Images/main-ic-gear-gray_54d864eb-b5de-4ee6-9b31-975dae0a5762.jpg) 
    next to a specific listener and select **Pause**.

    :::

    A confirmation dialog opens.

7.  Click **OK**.

    A message appears informing you the listeners have been paused. However, the list of listeners does not refresh automatically.

8. **Optional:** To refresh the list of listeners, click **![Refresh](../Images/main-bt-arrows-gray-curved-refresh_3793feaf-5057-4b6a-9bd8-c830f4292d40.jpg)**.
