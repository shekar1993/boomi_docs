You can search for JAR files by name in the **Installed Libraries** panel.

## Procedure

1.  On the **Installed Libraries** panel in the search box at the top of the list, type all or part of a JAR file name.

    You cannot search for folder names. In Folder view, the search results include matching files in the current folder only.

    The files whose names contain the characters that you typed are displayed in the list.

2.  To reset the list, do one of the following:

    -   Click the **Clear** icon.

    -   Press the **Esc** key.
