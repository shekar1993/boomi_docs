Read  [Boomi Customer Stories](https://boomi.com/customers/) to discover how organizations have achieved success using the Boomi Enterprise Platform.

### Mergers and Acquisitions

Massive Healthcare Group Inc. (MHG) has acquired Regional Hospital (RH). At the time of acquisition, MHG and RH identify the current data domains they want to digitally manage: patients, doctors, insurance providers, and non-physician staff. They use Boomi Integration and Boomi DataHub to create a single, validated view of MHG and RH’s patients that includes every physician, staff member, and insurance provider associated with their care.

Their data strategy eliminates siloed and disparate data between the two organizations. Boomi DataHub helps them ensure patient records are up to date and helps them identify missing data. They add additional information to their doctor domain, such as the physician's department, that allows patients to learn more about their doctor.

MHG and RH successfully create a seamless, unified patient experience and manage digital records from a central hub. MHG and RH increase the overall quality of patient care, remove low-quality data, and improve data access among internal staff.

## Maintaining Reliable Customer Records

Wholesale Supplier Inc. (WS) wants to improve the visibility and accuracy of customer data and orders across its Customer Relationship Management system (CRM), Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP), and internal e-commerce platform. Since customer data can be changed in the CRM and ERP, customer records and order statuses were often not up to date and available to everyone immediately.

With the Boomi Enterprise Platform and Boomi DataHub, they store and maintain a centralized repository of validated data. Any changes made in the CRM automatically synchronize and update information in their ERP and e-commerce platform. WS improves its order fulfillment process by providing visibility of order statuses and tracking numbers to all internal teams and customers.

## Automate Product Data Updates for Data Analytics
