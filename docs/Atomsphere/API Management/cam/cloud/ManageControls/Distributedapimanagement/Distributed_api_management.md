This section provides an overview of API Management's distributed API feature. 

Distributed API (DAPI) management involves the delegation and distribution of administrative functions for API Program assets, including APIs, users, and content. This allows groups within an Organization to manage their own data without impact to other groups' data.

API Management's Distributed API management solution enables customers to achieve the following benefits and value:

- S**implicity:** to reduce support costs, enterprises need simple user experiences with clearly defined roles and permissions so that undesired, unexpected changes are not made.

- **Scalability:** ability to push out API management capabilities throughout the enterprise means that everyone can move faster and IT or the API Management "expert" is no longer the bottleneck. 

- **Streamlining:** coupled with API Management API access, distributed API management support enables enterprises to automate processes and distribute out custom management applications, using the API Management API, in a controlled, secure fashion. 

The major features of API Management's Distributed API management include: 

- Organization/Sub-Org setup and management 

- Organization/Sub-Org specific roles 

- Permission support for read-only access

- Organization/Sub-Org API 

- Role-based access control (RBAC) on additional API Management objects: Services, Packages, Members, Applications, Package Keys, Interactive Documentation 

- RBAC-based access to above API Management objects in Portal 

- Integration with external roles and Organization/Sub-Org/Portal Access Group data via SAML SSO
