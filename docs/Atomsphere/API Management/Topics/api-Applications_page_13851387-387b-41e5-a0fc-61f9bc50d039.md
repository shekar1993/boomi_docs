The Application screen allows for the registration and management of Application names as a means of associating API subscriptions to their usage.

The Applications page allows you to register an application and view all of your enabled and disabled applications. The table of applications includes the following information:

**Name**

**Application Name**  
The name of your application. To edit the application, click the application name.

 When disabling the application status, the associated API Keys are disabled, but the subscription statuses are not modified. However, if the application status is disabled, you are unable to modify the subscription status.

**Status**
