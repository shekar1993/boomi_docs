To delete an Atom Cloud, uninstall or delete all of its Cloud Molecules from the primary account.

## About this task

If you are not using account groups, the primary account referred to below is just your account.

## Procedure

1.  If Atoms are installed on a Cloud Molecule in the primary account, do the following:

    1.  In the primary account, select **Manage** \> **Atom Management**.

    2.  On the Atoms or Environments panel on the left, select the Atom that is installed in the Cloud Molecule.

    3.  In Information, click **Atom Information**.

    4.  In the Atom panel on the right, click **Delete Atom**, then click **OK**.

    5.  Repeat these steps for each Atom that is installed on the Cloud Molecule.

2.  Delete each of the Atom Cloud's Cloud Molecules:

    1.  In the primary account, click the Manage menu, then select **Atom Management**.

    2.  On the Atoms or Environments panel on the left, select the Cloud Molecule.

    3.  In Information, click **Atom Information**.

    4.  In the Environments panel on the right, click **Delete Atom**, then click **OK**.

    5.  Repeat these steps for each Cloud Molecule.

    If the Cloud Molecule is shared with child accounts, deleting the Cloud Molecule makes it no longer available to the child accounts. Any Atoms that the child accounts have installed on the Cloud Molecule are no longer available either. When deleting a Cloud Molecule, as a courtesy you may want to notify the owners of the child accounts.

3.  Delete the Atom Cloud from the primary account.

    1.  Click the Manage menu, then select **Cloud Management**:

    2.  On the Clouds panel on the left, select the Atom Cloud, click the **Delete** icon, then click **OK**.

    If you have not completed the previous steps, a message explains why the Cloud cannot be deleted.
