The UKG Pro operation defines how to interact with your UKG Pro account and represents a specific action performed against a specific UKG Pro record type or object.

Create a separate operation component for each action/object combination required for your integration. The UKG Pro operation browses local and Cloud Atoms to generate and import profiles for the following actions:

-   Get — retrieves data from UKG Pro and returns it to the process.
-   Query — searches linked entities as well as entity types. When you select fields to query, the field names are appended to the URL. As a result, the browser’s URL length limit can be exceeded, which generates a 502 server error. If this happens, unselect all fields.


Click **Import Operation** to select the object\(s\) to integrate. The Import wizard uses the connector browser and imports the request and response profiles for the selected action.

## Options tab 

The following table describes the default field definitions for each action type:

**Object** - 
An object defines what you want to integrate or the action to run, which you select in the **Import Operation** wizard.

<ReturnErrRes />

**$skip** -
Skip the designated number of records and return the remaining records. For example, entering 25 skips the first 25 records and returns records 26 and higher.

**$top** -
Retrieve the designated number of top records. You can combine $top with $skip. For example, setting $skip to 25 retrieves records 26 and up. Setting $top to 5 then receives records 26 to 30.
