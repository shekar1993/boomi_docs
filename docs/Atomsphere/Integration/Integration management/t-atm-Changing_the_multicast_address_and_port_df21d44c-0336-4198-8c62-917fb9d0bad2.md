Change the multicast address and port if the address settings conflict with an existing product or if multiple Molecules or Atom Clouds are within the same network.

## Before you begin

You must have the Atom Management privilege to perform this task. If you have the Atom Management Read Access privilege, you cannot perform the task.

## About this task

To change the default Molecule node or Cloud Molecule multicast address 228.10.10.10 and port 45588, follow these steps.

## Procedure

1.  In the **Manage** menu, select **Atom Management**.

2.  Select the Molecule or Cloud Molecule from the list on the left.

3.  In Settings & Configuration, click **Properties**.

4.  Click the **Advanced** tab.

5.  Select the **Multicast Address** property, click **Add Property**, and add the multicast address in the **Property Value** field.

6.  Select the **Multicast Port** property, click **Add Property**, and add the multicast port in the **Property Value** field.
