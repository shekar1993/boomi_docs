SAP S4/HANA OData connector enables you to connect to SAP S4/HANA Cloud or SAP S4/HANA system via OData V2 \(Open Data Protocol\) services.

It allows to query and/or execute certain action defined as OData V2 APIs in SAP S4/HANA Cloud or SAP S4/HANA . Through this connector, you can use a Integration process to Create, Get, Query, Update/Patch/Merge, and Delete the business objects by making required OData API calls. The connector supports the Basic authentication method and the following communication protocols:

-   HTTP â€” if enabled
-   HTTPS

You can also browse through the list of available SAP S4/HANA OData service catalog during the import action or type the API if not available in the service catalog based on the available APIs in the SAP API Business Hub.

:::note

This is an open source connector and you can access the code in the [SAP S4/HANA OData](https://bitbucket.org/officialboomi/sap-s4-odata/src/master) connector repository.

## Connector configuration

To configure the connector to communicate with SAP S4/HANA via OData API , set up the following components:

-   SAP S4/HANA OData connection
-   SAP S4/HANA OData operation

This design provides reusable components which contain connection and operation settings. After building your connection and operation, set up your connector within a process. When the process is defined properly, Integration can map to and from virtually any system using the SAP S4/HANA OData \(Tech Preview\) connector to access the SAP S4/HANA business objects via OData APIs.

The SAP S4/HANA OData connector requires the following:

-   User login credentials for SAP S4/HANA Cloud or SAP S4/HANA.
-   All OData services configured and active in the SAP S4/HANA Cloud or SAP S4/HANA.
-   User must have necessary access permissions on the required OData APIs.
-   SAP S4/HANA client number, when not using SAP S4/HANA Cloud.

## Supported editions

The connector supports OData V2 APIs in the following SAP solutions:

-   SAP S4/HANA Cloud
