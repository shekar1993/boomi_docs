In addition to the Events two fundamental options, Events contains different appendixes that let you filter for specific events and payloads for better management of those options. 

  - [Event Filtering for Business Objects](./sap-Event_Filtering_for_Business_Objects.md)

  - [Event Payload Filter](./sap-Event_Payload_Filter.md)

  - [Change Pointer Event Filtering](/docs/Atomsphere/Boomi_for_SAP/sap-Change_Pointer_Event_Filtering.md)

  - [Change Pointer Payload](/docs/Atomsphere/Boomi_for_SAP/sap-Change_Pointer_Payload.md)
  
  - [Change Pointer Payload Filter](/docs/Atomsphere/Boomi_for_SAP/sap-Change_Pointer_Payload_Filter.md)

When creating an event subscription, the filtering options are based on the available data for the event, which are then mapped to link to the event data for payload extraction.
