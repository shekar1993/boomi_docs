:::warning

These connectors are now in Deprecated status. They are no longer available for new users and are not actively maintained. We will provide a minimum six-month notice before their retirement. We recommend upgrading to the newer supported version of these connectors.

For more information about the Deprecated stage, see the [Feature release stages page](../../Platform/atm-Feature_release_stages_00d83b66-e5db-4038-8398-fcaead4be12d.md).

:::

Deprecated connectors allow you to connect your flows to external applications, such as third-party APIs and data sources. They can also be used to extend the functionality of a flow, by adding authorization restrictions or sending emails for example.
