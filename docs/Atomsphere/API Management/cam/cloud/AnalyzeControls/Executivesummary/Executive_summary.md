To access the **Executive Summary** page, go to **Analyze > Executive Summary**.

The Executive Summary is designed to deliver a comprehensive suite of insights quickly and efficiently without any data collection and analysis tasks required. The Executive Summary is a complement to the existing reports also available on the administration dashboard and is designed for a wide audience such as API Administrators, API Product Managers, Business Development and Marketing Executives, and Technical Executive leadership. 

The **Executive Summary** page is divided into two sections: 

- [Calendar Heat Map](./Calendar_heat_map.md)

- [Summary Insights Groups](./Summary_insights_groups.md)

:::note

The summary data displayed in both sections is independent of each other.
