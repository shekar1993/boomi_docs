## What is the OpenProxy Specification

The OpenProxy Specification is an openly available standard, created by APIIDA AG, which provides a universal API specification. It enables consistent documentation and publishing of APIs across several platforms and technologies. This promotes interoperability, reusability of APIs and advances their development.

When properly defined via OpenProxy, a publisher can create and update API proxies on different API Gateways or API Management Services, without knowing their implementation specifics. Together with existing consumer-centric specifications like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI or GraphQL Schema this creates a complete technology-agnostic way of documentation and working with APIs.

The OpenProxy Specification is used in the Boomi API Control Plane to manage and document APIs across platforms. This enables seamless integration of APIs on different platforms and contributes to efficiency and consistency in API Management.

## Version 1.0
The first version sets the foundation for the Open Proxy Specification and covers the essential building blocks of an API. With this version, we provide a solid basis for API descriptions that allows to capture and document important aspects of an API proxy.
