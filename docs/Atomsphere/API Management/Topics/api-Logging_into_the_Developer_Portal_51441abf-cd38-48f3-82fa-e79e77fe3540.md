To request access to APIs through a Developer Portal, you must first sign in. The Developer Portal owner will provide you information on how to sign in.

# Procedure


1.  Open the web URL provided by the Developer Portal owner.

2.  Click **Sign In**.

    The way that you sign in to the Developer Portal differs based on the authentication method that the API owner set up. If you have access to multiple Developer Portals, clicking **Sign In** may have different results.

3.  Sign in based on the authentication method for the Developer Portal.

    |Authentication Method|Sign in information|
    |---------------------|-------------------|
    |**Basic Authentication**|The Developer Portal owner will provide you with a user name and password. Enter the provided user name and password and click **Sign In**.|
    |**OpenID, SAML, or JWT**|The API owner set up an authentication method that you will be required to use to sign in. It is possible that a single sign-on was set up with a system that you are already signed in to. In that case, you will automatically be signed in.|
