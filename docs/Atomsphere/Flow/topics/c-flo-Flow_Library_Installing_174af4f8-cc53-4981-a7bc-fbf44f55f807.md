Installing a flow from the Flow Library creates a copy of the flow in your Tenant.

## Installing a resource from Flow Library

1.  Open the **Flow Library** page. See [Flow Library page](c-flo-Flow_Library_Page_7fa7146c-229c-4f92-812e-e731189c55b2.md).
2.  Click **Install** on the flow that you wish to install.
3.  A copy of the flow will be installed in your tenant and opened in a new tab, ready to view and edit as required.

**Note:** If a flow already exists in your Tenant with the same name as the resource, the copy will be created and a number appended to the name \(for example, 'Basic Form Build 1'\).
