You can search the Component Explorer for components that have been deleted, then restore the deleted component that you need.

## Procedure

1.  On the **Build** page in the Component Explorer, click the **Filter** button. Under the **Deleted Components** filter category, turn on the **Show Deleted Components** filter option.

    All categories and folders that contain deleted components, as well as the deleted components themselves, appear in the Component Explorer. Note that active components are also included in filter results.

2.  Locate the component that you want to restore by clicking the **plus sign** icon next to the folder or category in which it is located.

3.  Once you find the component that you are looking for, click the ![icon](../Images/main-ic-arrow-blue-down-16=GUID-CA79043B-869E-4C8B-A46E-5D4D4FA1DBEE=1=en-us=Low_ee257e3c-4362-486e-b1f1-4d613b679c4c.jpg) arrow next to it to expand the options menu.

    If it is a deleted component, there is a **Restore** option available on the menu.

    If the folder in which the component is stored has write restrictions on it and if you are not assigned a user role that allows write access to that folder, this option is not available.

4.  Do one of the following:

    -   Click **Restore** and click **OK** to confirm.

    -   Double-click the component to open it in the process canvas. Click **Save** or **Save and Close**.

    The component is restored to its original location.

5.  Repeat steps 3â€“5 for each component that you want to restore.

6.  In the Component Explorer, click **Filter**and then click **Clear all Filters**.
