# Adding integration packs to a Space

Integration packs (iPacks) are pre-defined integrations that include one or more packaged components and processes, ready for installation. Integration packs created in the Boomi Enterprise Platform are accessible in the Spaces Admin UI. As an admin, you can add these integration packs to the appropriate account group. 

Read [Integration Pack Development](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Integration%20packs/c-atm-Integration_pack_development_1dbd79c2-3cca-4456-aab8-3f8dc37b191a.md) to learn more about integration packs and their development.

You can add integration packs with either a single attachment or multiple attachments, depending on your use case. A single-attachment iPack allows the installation of only one instance of the integration per account, whereas multi-install attachment iPacks allow the installation of multiple instances of the integration per account, providing greater flexibility for different business scenarios.


To add an integration pack to a Space:

1. On the **Spaces** page, click on the name of the Space to which you want to add an integration pack. The **Space Information** page opens.
2. On the left pane of the Space Information page, navigate to the **Integration Pack**.
3. Click **Add Integration Packs to Account Group**.
4. Select the **Integration Pack** from the drop-down list.
The drop-down list displays all integration packs available to the account group associated with the Space.

5. Click **Add** to finish adding the integration pack to the Space.

:::note

 Integration packs added by Admin in the Admin Space will be visible in the User Space portal.
