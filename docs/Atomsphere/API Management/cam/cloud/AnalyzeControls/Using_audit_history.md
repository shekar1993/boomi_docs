Audit log data can be fetched from API Management Control Center using the Audit History feature. 

To access the Audit History page, go to Analyze > Audit History. 

The Audit History menu item is visible only to Area Admin and Mashadmin roles. 

The main Audit History page shows the available options for fetching audit data: 

- Users

- Applications

- Package Keys

- User Permissions

Upon selecting an option, a new page displays the audit log for the specified data in grid format with pagination, and a download button to export the data. 

Due to limitations from potentially huge amounts of data, download data is limited to the last 90 days only.
