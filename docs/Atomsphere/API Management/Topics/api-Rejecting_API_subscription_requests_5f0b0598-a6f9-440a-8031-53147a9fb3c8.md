If your users request access to an API through your Developer Portal that you do not want them to have access to, you need to reject their subscription request.

## Procedure


1.  In API Management, go to **Approve**.

2.  Expand the Gateway to see the users who requested access to APIs on that Gateway.

3.  From the correct row in the table for the user and API, click **Pending Approval** in the **Status** column.

4.  Click **Reject**.

5.  **Optional:** Type a message to the requester.

6.  Click **Reject**.

7.  If there are additional requests, click **Next** to see the next entry that needs to be approved or rejected. Or, if there are no additional requests, click **Return to List** to return to the main Approvals page.
