The Inject Conditional Header connector provides an ability to inject headers in the API response based on HTTP response condition. 

This connector: 

- Allows options for hardening HTTP security headers, for example: cache-control, content-security-policy, and x-content-type-options. 

- Allows static headers injection to request/response even when no condition is provided. 
- Allows injecting same header with multiple values. 

- Supports both pre-processing and post-processing.
