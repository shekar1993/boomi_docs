The Reject Quarantined Entity for Transaction operation resolves a quarantine entry for a potential duplicate error or a record already end-dated error. The operation rejects the quarantined entity sends a REJECT update to the source so that the source and Hub are in sync. This operation is associated with a specified quarantine transaction from a given universe (deployed model) for the authenticated user.

## Basic authentication

To perform this operation using Basic auth, send an **HTTP POST** request with an empty request body to:

`https://<host>:<port>/mdm/universes/<universeID>/quarantine/<transactionID>/reject`

where

*host* is the host name or IP address of the repository and `port` is the port number of the shared HTTP server as configured in the accountâ€™s [Atom Management settings](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Integration%20management/c-atm-Atom_Management_b38a3a90-d7f6-4df0-8c00-e75a178dfdfa.md).

## JWT authentication

To perform this operation using JSON Web Token (JWT) auth, send an **HTTP POST** request with an empty request body to:

`https://<host>:<port>/mdm/universes/<universeID>/quarantine/<transactionID>/reject?repositoryId=<repository ID>`

You must have the following MDM privileges:

- With the Advanced Security feature on your account:
  - **MDM - Stewardship** with the **Reject Quarantine** [Hub role entitlement](/docs/Atomsphere/Master%20Data%20Hub/Getting%20started/t-hub-Creating_Hub_Role_Entitlements_06d21275-b0c6-4854-abef-5782326aa85b.md) for the queried repository <br></br>or
  - **MDM - Stewardship Management**

- Without Advanced Security: 
   - **MDM - Stewardship** 


## Path parameters 

**universeID**  
ID of the universe

**transactionID**  
ID of the transaction, which you can obtain from a Query Quarantine Entries operation. It must be URL encoded if it contains special characters.

## Query parameters

**repositoryId** <br></br>
ID of the repository. Case sensitive. Required with JWT authentication only. You can obtain the repository ID from the URL after navigating to the repository in the user interface.

       <message>This quarantine transaction is not rejectable.</message>

- 400 (Bad Request) The *universeID* parameter value contains only space characters. Sample response body:

      ```xml
      <error>
         <message>The given universe id is blank.</message>
      </error> 
      ```

- 404 (Not Found) *universeID* does not identify a universe under the authenticated account. Sample response body:

      ```xml
