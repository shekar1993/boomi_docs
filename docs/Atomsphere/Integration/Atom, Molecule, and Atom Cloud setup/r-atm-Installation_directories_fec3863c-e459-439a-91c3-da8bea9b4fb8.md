In this topic, you can find information about the installation directories for local Atoms, Molecules, and private Atom Clouds.

:::note
Some assets for clustered runtimes can and should be configured to use local node storage. Refer to [Molecule and Atom Cloud local storage](../Integration%20management/c-atm-Molecule_and_Atom_Cloud_working_data_storage_b18ef1af-1e37-4a33-8712-d600f4e7b29d.md) for further details. 
:::

Boomi Support can use the directories noted in the Description column in the following table for troubleshooting.

:::caution

Unless specifically instructed to do so by documentation or Support, do not modify files in these directories.

bounds | (Atoms, Molecules, Multi-tenant Clouds)<br />Lock file for Singleton Listen operations.<br />- File locks for multi-tenant Clouds appear in an account subdirectory. The account identifier deploying the listener identifies the subdirectory.<br />- File locks for single-tenant Atoms and Molecules appear in the root bounds directory and do not create an account subdirectory.<br />- A unique number identifies the lock file.

| doccache | Temporary directory for the Document Cache component.<br /> Typically empty except when running processes. | Single execution | When running processes that use the document cache | Yes (temporarily) |
| endorsed | Additional runtime library files. | Permanent | Upon install | No |
| execution | Run artifacts such as process and document logs, in the following subdirectories:<br />- `/<root> `(persisted process properties by component ID)<br />- `/current` (artifacts for in-progress runs; moved to /history upon completion)<br />- /error (metadata regarding failed process runs; internal use only)<br />- /history (historical run artifacts by date)<br />- /recovery (temporary state of abnormally terminated process runs; used for cleanup) | Atom purge schedule | When every process runs | Yes (run history) |

When you deploy those components, Integration deploys the JAR files to `/userlib` or an appropriate subdirectory, such as `/script` or `/database`. Integration creates the directory if it does not exist.<br /><br />Important for troubleshooting. | Permanent | Created as needed for custom scripting libraries and connector drivers | No |
| work | Working copies of libraries loaded into memory at runtime, as well as some history run artifacts, including:<br /><br />- `/as2` (AS2 artifacts, including inbound and outbound raw MIME messages and synchronous MDNs)<br />- `/cdc` (change data capture, which are snapshots of the Find Changes step) | Permanent (except for `/as2`, which is subject to the Atom purge schedule) | Upon Atom startup and process runs | Yes |
