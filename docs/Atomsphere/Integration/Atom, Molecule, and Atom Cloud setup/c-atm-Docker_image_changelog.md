- Images no longer require privileged mode to operate, nor do they require mounting to the host's cgroup. Docker images now run as a non-root user, addressing concerns pertaining to running applications with escalated privileges. (RUN-1672)
- To provide greater monitoring flexibility, images are configured by default (via the [Enable Standard Output and Error Logging property](../Integration%20management/r-atm-Properties_panel_Advanced_tab_c39737e8-1b16-4fdd-b414-152694364c14.md)) to enable logging to `stdout` and `stderr` in addition to the container log. 
- To better facilitate timely readiness of deployed runtime containers, the runtime property, [Force Start Shared Web Server](../Integration%20management/r-atm-Properties_panel_Advanced_tab_c39737e8-1b16-4fdd-b414-152694364c14.md), allows the Shared Web Server to always be started, even when no listeners have been deployed to the runtime. 
- To better assess the status, two new API operations are available to return information for the [readiness and liveness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/). 
    - The liveness operation, `GET <sharedWebServerUrl>:<sharedWebServerPort>/_admin/liveness`, returns HTTP status code 200 (OK) if the container is running.
    - The readiness operation, `GET <sharedWebServerUrl>:<sharedWebServerPort>/_admin/readiness`, returns HTTP status code 200 (OK) if the container is ready to start accepting traffic.
- To facilitate greater portability, image sizes have been reduced by roughly 60% (down from ~500MB to ~200MB) by switching to the Alpine Linux base image.
- For improved awareness, the image version is now available as a [runtime startup property](../Integration%20management/r-atm-Startup_Properties_panel_289292e3-6746-48b8-ab81-38c9c1e8a3ad.mdIntegration%20management/) in the platform UI.
