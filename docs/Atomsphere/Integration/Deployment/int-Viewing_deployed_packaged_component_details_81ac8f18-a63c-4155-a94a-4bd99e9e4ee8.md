Use the Packaged Components page to view detailed information about a specific version of a packaged component that has been deployed.

## About this task

From the Packaged Components Details page, you can perform various actions such as viewing details about a specific version of the packaged component, viewing a list child components included with the primary component, determining if the packaged component was deployed and to which environment, and finally if the version was shared within the process library or an integration pack.

## Procedure

1. From the **Deploy** menu, select **Deployments**.

    The Deployments page opens.

2. To see the full list of deployments, use the Clear ![img-int-blue_circle_with_white_x](../Images/img-int-blue_circle_with_white_x_8a03d8b0-defd-4cfc-bcc1-b3d53392b78b.jpg) button to remove the "Past Week date filter that is applied by default.

3. From the list on the Deployments page, locate a packaged component whose details you want to view.

4. Click the **Action** menu ![img-int-black_gear](../Images/main-ic-gear-black-16_cdde83e4-a176-436a-86ca-1fe4937e3085.jpg) icon next to the packaged component that you chose, and select **Deployment History** from the list of options.

    The Deployments History dialog appears and displays records of all versions of the component that were deployed, including the environment to which it was deployed, and if the deployment is active.

5. Click the **Actions**![img-int-black_gear](../Images/main-ic-gear-black-16_cdde83e4-a176-436a-86ca-1fe4937e3085.jpg) menu on a version from the list of deployed components, and select **Package Component Details**.

    The Package Component Details screen opens detailed information about your selected version of the deployed packaged component.

6. View the Details, Included Components, Deployments, Process Library, and Integration Packs tabs as necessary.

    **Note:** For in-depth information about the additional tabs within the Packaged Component Details panel, see the Related Links section.
