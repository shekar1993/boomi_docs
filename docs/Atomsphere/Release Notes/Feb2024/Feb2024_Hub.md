**We added this feature:**

#### Golden Record Profiling (Tech Preview)

Golden record profiling lets you analyze statistics about model field metadata for deployed Hub models. Viewing characteristics and attributes for field values helps your organization:

- Gain a deeper understanding of golden record fields

- Accelerate business decisions about models

- Assess data quality and troubleshoot issues

Navigate to the repositoryâ€™s **Statistics** tab to run statistics and view metadata about the deployed Hub model and field values. A graph is available when we can display field values as a histogram. Read [Running statistics](/docs/Atomsphere/Master%20Data%20Hub/Stewardship/hub-running_statistics.md) and [Viewing golden record field statistics](/docs/Atomsphere/Master%20Data%20Hub/Stewardship/hub-Viewing_golden_record_field_statistics.md) to learn more.(HUB-3148)

**We fixed this issue:**

Editing advanced expressions in match rules no longer causes errors. (HUB-2252)
