After developers register themselves on the Portal, their developer accounts are visible on the Users page of the Dashboard. You can also add users through this interface. 

**To add a user:**

1. Click **Manage > Users**. 

   The **Users page** is displayed. 

2. On the Users page, click **New User**. 

   The **New User** page is displayed. 

3. On the **New User** page, enter the information in the fields. 

   Ensure that you provide information for all the fields that are marked as required.

   :::note
   
   The **Username** cannot be changed once the user is created, so including personal or private information is not recommended for privacy reasons.

   :::

4. Click **Save and Continue**. 

5. In the **Personal Information window**, all fields are optional.

   :::note
   
   Once you close this window, the fields are no longer editable from the Control Center. Only the user will be able to edit these fields from the Developer Portal.

   :::

6. Click **Save and Close** or **Save and Continue**.

   A new user is created for the Portal. You can view this username in the **Manage your Users** list on the **Users** page. 

### Account Authentication Notes

- After **5** incorrect login attempts, the account is locked out, and the login page displays the following message: 

*You have had too many failed login attempts. Try again in an hour.*

- If the user is successfully logged in but inactive for 30 minutes, the session expires and requires login again. After 30 minutes of inactivity, if you try to perform any action on the portal, you will be redirected to the login page with the following message.

*Your session has been idle for too long. Please sign in again.*
