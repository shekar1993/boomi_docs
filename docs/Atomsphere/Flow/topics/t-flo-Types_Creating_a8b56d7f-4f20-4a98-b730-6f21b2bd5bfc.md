Although types are usually created as part of a installation, you can create your own custom types from the **Types** page.

## Creating a new type

1.  Click **New Type** on the **Types** page.
2.  The **Type** page is displayed ready for you to configure.
3.  **Name**: Enter a name for the type.
4.  **Comments:** This optional field allows you to insert information about the type that can then be viewed within . These comments are not visible in a flow to runtime users.
5.  Add properties to the type as required:
    1.  Click **New Property** to add a new property. The **Property** page is displayed.
    2.  **Name**: Enter a name for the property.
    3.  **What kind of Property is this?**: Select the type of property that you wish to create.

        -   If you select either the 'List' or 'Object' option, the **What Type of Value is this?** field is shown. This allows you to link the type to a value. See [Understanding Values, Types, Objects, and Lists](c-flo-Values_Understanding_0a938b9f-c1be-45d9-b53f-aa9d0addad86.md) for more information.

        -   If you select either the 'Date/Time' or 'Number' option, the **The format that should be applied to this Property** field is shown. This allows you to apply a specific output format to any properties of this type.

    4.  Click **Apply Property** to save the property and return to the **Type** page.
    5.  The properties you have added are displayed on the page and can be edited or deleted as required.
6.  Click **Save Type** to save and create the new type.
