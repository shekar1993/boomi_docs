Folders can be deleted from CMS. Deleting a folder deletes all the pages within the folder. While you can individually delete pages in the folder, you cannot delete the folder home page. The folder home page is deleted only when the parent folder is deleted. 

## To delete a folder

1. On the Content page, in the left panel, select the **Custom Pages folder** or the **Documentation** folder by clicking it. 

   A list of pages and folders under the selected root folder is displayed in the right panel.

2. Select a folder and click **Delete this folder**.

3. A confirmation box is displayed. 

4. Click **Yes** to confirm deletion. 

   The folder is removed from the list. All the pages within the folder are also deleted. 

:::note

To delete a folder, click a folder in the left panel, and then click **Delete** this folder in the right panel.
