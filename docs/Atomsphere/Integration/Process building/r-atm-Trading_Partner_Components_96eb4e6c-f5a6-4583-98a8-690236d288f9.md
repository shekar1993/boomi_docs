A Trading Partner component contains the configuration details for your company or for a trading partner.

Create one Trading Partner component for your company and another for each company with which you will conduct an EDI interchange. To help distinguish between the two components, Component Explorer contains **My Company Settings** and **Trading Partner Settings** under the Trading Partners grouping.

Trading Partner component configuration settings are extensible except where noted in the description of a given setting.
