You can create only a single channel for an area. Once a channel is created it cannot be deleted. 

:::

Use the following steps to create a new log stream channel and corresponding access token: 

1. Click **Analyze > Call Log Stream** to open the **Call Log Streams** page. 

   If creating a channel for the first time, the **Call Log Stream Configuration Wizard** opens automatically. 

   Or, click **Create your first Channel** to open the **Call Log Stream Configuration Wizard**.

2. Click **Generate** to create a new channel and access token.

   The channel is assigned a default name of "Channel for AREA NAME", which is the name of the area in your installation. 

   The information is stored on the **Access Token** page associated with your Call Log Stream Channel configuration. 

3. Click **Close**. The new Call Log Stream Channel Record is added to the Call Log Streams list.
