Once you have uploaded an asset, you can include the asset within your flows.

## Insert an asset from the Asset Manager

You can browse for and select an asset directly from certain points within Boomi Flow. For example, to add an image into a flow web application:

1.  Open a flow and add a step map element onto the flow canvas.
2.  Open the step map element and click **Insert/edit image** ![Edit Type](../Images/img-flo-Icon_insertimage_95303c48-1fb4-4de2-98eb-cd7b8bb3d184.png) from the content menu.
3.  Click on the **browse** icon in the **Source** field to open the **Asset Manager**.
4.  Click on the asset you wish to insert from the asset library and click **Insert Asset**.
