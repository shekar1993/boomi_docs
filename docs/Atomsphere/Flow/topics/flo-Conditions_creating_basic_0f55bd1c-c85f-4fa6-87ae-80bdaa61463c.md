Create a basic page condition on a page layout.

Add any page layout components and values that you will use when adding the page condition to a page layout.

Create a basic page condition to change the state of a component in a page layout, based on the value of another component. The values and options you select are used to build the conditional logic of the page condition.

1.  Open the page layout for the page that you wish to apply the page condition to.

2.  Select **Basic Conditions** from the right-hand menu.

3.  Select the page component that you wish to compare from the **When the value of** field.

4.  Select the logical expression to apply from the drop-down menu to the right of this field. For example, "is equal to".

5.  Select the value to use with the logical expression, or create and configure a new value.

6.  Select the page component that you wish to modify from the **then make** field.

7.  Select the state to apply to the selected component as a result of the conditional statement you have built. For example, whether the component should be visible, required, or enabled.

8.  Click **Save Basic Condition** to save the page condition.


-   Run the flow and test your page condition works as expected.

-   View and edit the page condition on the **Page Conditions** panel. See [Editing page conditions](flo-Conditions_editing_44cf6656-d04f-47b0-ae9b-4a7fd47bc744.md).
