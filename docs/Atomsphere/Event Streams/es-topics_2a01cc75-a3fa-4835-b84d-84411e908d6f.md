Topics function as channels where producers can publish messages and consumers can subscribe to receive those messages.

## Overview 

Typically, topics will be organized by the application and business event \(for example, Workday Employees or Salesforce Accounts\). All messages stored within a topic are persistent and durably stored on disk until they are acknowledged by all of the consumers.

:::note 

Unacknowledged messages are retained for 14 days before they are removed from the topic.
