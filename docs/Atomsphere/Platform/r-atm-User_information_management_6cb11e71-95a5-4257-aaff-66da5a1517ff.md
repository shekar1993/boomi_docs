On the User Information panel in the **Settings** page, you can manage the user name, password, email, and time zone.

The information on the **User Information** panel in the Settings page applies to the user signed in to the Boomi Enterprise Platform. You can change all of the user information displayed on this panel. You must sign in as an alternate user to configure that user's information.

If you cannot sign in to the Boomi Enterprise Platform because you have forgotten your password or because you are locked out after six invalid sign in attempts, you must reset your password. On the Platform sign in page, enter your email address and click the **Reset your password** link. An email containing instructions about resetting your password is sent to your email address. If you do not reset your password within 30 minutes, you will need to repeat this process.

:::note

SSO users that used their identity provider to sign into the platform but are currently locked out must have the account administrator [unlock their user](int-Unlocking_an_sso_user_ee1a1ec0-0997-4434-b76a-fcafd6b3a9fa.md) from the User Management page.
