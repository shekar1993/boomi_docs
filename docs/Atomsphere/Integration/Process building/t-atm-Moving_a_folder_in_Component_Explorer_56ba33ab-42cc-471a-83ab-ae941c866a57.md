You can reorganize component folders by dragging and dropping them.

## Procedure

1.  Click the folder and drag it to a new location.

    If the destination is valid, it is highlighted in green.

2.  Drop the folder in the new location.

    If the location is invalid, it is not highlighted in green and you cannot to drop it there.

    If the folder, its parent folder or the destination folder has write restrictions on it and if you are not assigned a user role that allows write access to one of those folders, you receive an error message and the folder is not moved.

    If the location is valid, and if the folder \(and sub-folders\) being moved has write restrictions on it, the write restrictions are maintained in the new location.
