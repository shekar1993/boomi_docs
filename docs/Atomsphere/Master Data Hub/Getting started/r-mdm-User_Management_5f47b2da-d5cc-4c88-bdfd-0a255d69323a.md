Administrators give a Boomi Enterprise Platform user access to one or more Boomi accounts using their unique email address. User management is performed in Integration. Administrators assign a role to a user to control their access to areas in Master Data Hub.

Administrators can control general account and user settings for all Boomi Enterprise Platform services by navigating to **User Information** \> **Account Information and Setup**. Administrators can configure user access in **User Information** \> **Account Information and Setup** \> **User Management**. Read [User management settings](/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/r-atm-User_management_baf961e2-b480-4fca-a3f5-8262aed6c031.md) to learn more about general settings for the platform.

Administrators can assign a role to a user for a specific account. Roles contain a list of privileges. A privilege is an allowable action or access to a specific area of platform.

There are several default Boomi DataHub roles with a predefined list of privileges.

-  MDM Administrator
-  MDM Standard User
-  MDM Data Steward
-  MDM Developer
-  MDM View Only
-  MDM Privileged Data Steward

Instead of assigning a predefined role, you can [create custom roles](/docs/Atomsphere/Master%20Data%20Hub/Getting%20started/t-hub-Creating_custom_roles_10e7d3e0-11fc-11ee-be56-0242ac120002.md) for users and restrict access to specific objects or areas in Master Data Hub using [Hub role entitlements](docs/Atomsphere/Master%20Data%20Hub/Getting%20started/t-hub-Creating_Hub_Role_Entitlements_06d21275-b0c6-4854-abef-5782326aa85b.md). This option is available with the Advanced User Security feature, which is available in the Enterprise and Enterprise Plus Editions, and as an add-on to the Professional and Professional Plus Editions.

The table below shows the predefined standard roles for users, the privileges assigned to each role, and descriptions of the privileges.
