A Integration process call data quality step in a model specifies a Integration Hub listener process that is or will be deployed to the Boomi Hub Cloud that hosts the repository to which the model is deployed.

Hub listener process deployment is relatively straightforward. Hub listener processes are automatically deployed to Hub Clouds and ordinary processes to ordinary environments.
