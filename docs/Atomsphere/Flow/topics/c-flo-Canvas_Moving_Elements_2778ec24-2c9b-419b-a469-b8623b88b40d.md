Once you have added map elements to the flow canvas, these map elements can then be moved around on the canvas and positioned to suit your workflow layout.

To move and position a map element on the flow canvas:

1.  Click and hold on the map element on the flow canvas.
2.  Move the map element to the desired new position.
3.  Release and drop the map element onto the flow canvas. Any connected outcomes will be automatically re-positioned, but may now overlap other elements on the flow canvas and require repositioning. See [Re-positioning the outcome connector arrow](c-flo-Canvas_Joining_Elements_dfc06eea-8adf-4baa-a35e-4e8a3d3b1e75.md#section_kgq_2t4_gkb) and [Best practice for flow canvas layout](c-flo-Canvas_Layout_58a35d34-73e5-46f9-bcf1-1489e4f8815a.md).
