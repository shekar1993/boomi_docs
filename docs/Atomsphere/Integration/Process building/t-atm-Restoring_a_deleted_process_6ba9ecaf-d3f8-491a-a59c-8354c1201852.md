You can also restore a deleted Process component from Process Reporting if the process was deployed and executed on an Atom within the last 30 days prior to being deleted.

## Procedure

1.  Go to **Manage** \> **Process Reporting**.

2.  Select the latest execution of the process that you want to restore.

3.  In the **![icon](../Images/main-ic-gear-blue-and-arrow-black-16_188e61d7-2204-48ad-b085-15fa4a70615d.jpg) Actions** menu, select **View Process**.

    The process opens on the Build page with a red banner indicating that it has been deleted.

    If the process is in a folder with write restrictions on it and if you are not assigned a user role that allows write access to the folder, the process opens in read-only mode. You cannot save or restore it.

4.  Click **Save** or **Save and Close**.

    The process is restored to its original location in the Component Explorer.
