## Organizations

Organizations are used to group APIs and users and to represent corporate structures. They act as an owner of APIs, applications, and users. Apart from a global admin, no user can access elements, that are not owned by the organization she belongs to. APIs can be shared with other organizations however, by configuring the visibility of the API. 

For more information on organizations see [Configuration Organizations](../Topics/cp-Configuration_organisation.md). 

## Visibility

For every API the visibility can be configured. You can select if an API will be shown to all users or only the users of specific organizations. 

For more information on the visibility of APIs, see [API Product Visibility](../Topics/cp-API_products.md).
