You need to have the Services Enablement feature to access some dashboards.

## Procedure

1.  Click the arrow next to the **Dashboard** menu on the menu bar.

2.  Select one of the following:

    -   **Account Dashboard**

    -   **HTTP Status Dashboard** \(available only if the Services Enablement feature is enabled in your account\)

    -   **Real-time Dashboard** \(available only if the Services Enablement feature is enabled in your account\)

    The Account Dashboard displays showing the details of your account; the HTTP Status Dashboard displays showing status code summary and status codes by time; or the Real-time Dashboard displays showing low latency processes.

3.  View the information icons in the upper-right corner of each gadget within a dashboard. Pause on an icon to learn more about the features of its gadget.
