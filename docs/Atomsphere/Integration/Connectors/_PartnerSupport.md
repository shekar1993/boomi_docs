Partner connectors developed by our Tech Partners and published on the Boomi platform provide seamless integration solutions for customers. Customers will initiate support for these connectors through the [Boomi Support Portal](https://community.boomi.com/s/support), where tickets will be triaged to the respective partner. The partner or their designated third party is responsible for ongoing support, including troubleshooting, bug fixes, and resolving related issues.
