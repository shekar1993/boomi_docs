The model page is used to view, create or modify a model.

The page’s title heading is the name of the model. Breadcrumbs indicate whether the model is a published or draft version and, for a published version, the version number. For a published model having a newer draft definition, this page can be used only to view the published version, read-only. This page can be opened in a separate browser tab or window to view a selected published version, read only, by clicking **![icon](../Images/Models/main-ic-arrow-popping-from-square_6b63e5cc-2b87-419a-bebf-383676aa724e.jpg) View this version of the model** for that version in the Model Publication History view, which is accessible from the Models page or the repository page’s **Summary** tab.

The page has the following tabs:

-   [**Name and Root Element**](/docs/Atomsphere/Master%20Data%20Hub/Menu/hub-Name_and_Root_Element_Name_tab_f4bf607c-58ce-4cfa-a8c1-ee8899842f3b.md)

## Action buttons 

The buttons are used to apply actions to the model. The available actions are as follows:

-   Upon creation of a model before the model is saved:

    ![The available actions upon creation of a model before the model is saved are Publish, Save as Draft, and Cancel.](../Images/Models/mdm-bt-bar-model-new_369fad69-c806-464f-a53c-7d73b501ad28.jpg)

-   During modification of a saved, never before published model:

    ![The available actions during modification of a saved, never before published model are Publish, Save as Draft, Delete this Model, and Close.](../Images/Models/mdm-bt-bar-model-undeployed_43e9a885-d760-4d18-90b2-5cb9f8eb95fc.jpg)

-   During modification of a published but not yet deployed model for which a newer draft has not been saved:

    ![The available actions during modification of a published but not yet deployed model for which a newer draft has not been saved are Public, Save as Draft, Delete this Model, and Close.](../Images/Models/mdm-bt-bar-model-undeployed_43e9a885-d760-4d18-90b2-5cb9f8eb95fc.jpg)

-   During modification of a draft version of a published but not yet deployed model:

    ![The available actions during modification of a draft version of a published but not yet deployed model are Publish, Save as Draft, Remove Draft, Delete this Model, and Close.](../Images/Models/mdm-bt-bar-model-undeployed-revising_10d823f0-a965-4ee6-ba6b-63e698fe8142.jpg)

-   During modification of a deployed model for which a newer draft has not been saved:

    ![The available actions during modification of a deployed model for which a newer draft has not been saved are Publish, Save as Draft, and Close.](../Images/Models/mdm-bt-bar-model-deployed_6563455b-6c1b-4c77-a36d-19342fa7ea12.jpg)

-   During modification of a draft version of a deployed model:

    ![The available actions during modification of a draft version of a deployed model are Publish, Save as Draft, Remove Draft, and Close.](../Images/Models/mdm-bt-bar-model-deployed-revising_3c7a85bb-9e77-42b6-b6b9-f1dd4e55d6d9.jpg)

-   While viewing the published version of a model for which a newer draft was previously saved:

    ![The available actions while viewing the published version of a model for which a newer draft was previously saved are View Draft Version and Close.](../Images/Models/mdm-bt-bar-model-view-only_2e67a9e1-4cfe-4797-b9b1-f24fed11908f.jpg)

-   While viewing a published version selected from the Model Publication History view or the repository page’s **Versions** tab:

    ![The available action while viewing a published version selected from the Model Publication History view or the repository page’s Versions tab is Close.](../Images/Models/mdm-bt-bar-model-separate-tab_98b532dc-80e0-4255-85b3-3321ebf6f00b.jpg)



**Publish**   
Saves the model as defined on this page \(as if **Save as Draft** had been clicked\) and initiates a request to publish the model.

A dialog appears containing a text box into which you can optionally type a note documenting the changes to the model, or, in the case of the initial publication, describing the model. If the note is longer than 4000 characters, the note is truncated.

![Dialog used to initiate a request to publish the model](../Images/Models/mdm-db-publication-note_5d0336ac-e371-4c2e-b47e-41d97726b638.jpg)

In this dialog:

-   Clicking **Save** executes the publish operation. This dialog confirms a successful outcome:

    ![Dialog indicating success of the requested publish operation](../Images/Models/mdm-db-model-published_4c3a8047-c8fd-4d8d-9004-cb1bd50e52be.jpg)

    Once a model is published, it can be deployed to repositories.

-   Clicking **Close** cancels the request.


:::note

A model cannot be published if any of the following is true:

-   A field specified in a match rule is deleted from the model.

-   A field specified in a tag definition is deleted from the model.

 -   The id field is the model’s only field.

-   The name of a non-reference field in the model is longer than 64 characters.

-   The name of a reference field in the model is longer than 53 characters minus the number of characters in the model’s root element name. For example, a model with the root element name contact \(seven characters\) cannot be published if it has a reference field with a name longer than 46 characters.

-   The name of a collection in the model is longer than 58 characters minus the number of characters in the model’s root element name. For example, a model with the root element name contact \(seven characters\) cannot be published if it has a collection with a name longer than 51 characters.

-   The model does not have at least one match rule.

 -   A match rule in the model consists only of a fuzzy match expression or grouped fuzzy match expressions.

-   A match rule in the model contains a fuzzy match expression grouped using an OR or NOT operator.


The failure of a publishing operation is indicated by a dialog containing a description of the error\(s\).

:::

**Save as Draft**  
Saves the model as defined on this page as a draft.

:::note

A model cannot be saved as a draft if either of the following is true:

-   The name of a non-reference field in the model is longer than 64 characters.

-   The name of a reference field in the model is longer than 53 characters minus the number of characters in the model’s root element name. For example, a model with the root element name contact \(seven characters\) cannot be saved if it has a reference field with a name longer than 46 characters.

-   The name of a collection in the model is longer than 58 characters minus the number of characters in the model’s root element name. For example, a model with the root element name contact \(seven characters\) cannot be saved if it has a collection with a name longer than 51 characters.

:::


**Remove Draft**  
Initiates a request to abandon the current draft model definition and, if the model was previously published, to revert to the most recent version. In the confirmation dialog:

-   Clicking **OK** executes the operation.

-   Clicking **Cancel** cancels the request.


**Delete this Model**  
Initiates a request to delete the model. In the confirmation dialog:

 -   Clicking **OK** executes the operation.

-   Clicking **Cancel** cancels the request.


It is possible to delete a model only while it is not deployed to a repository.

:::caution

Once a model is deleted, it cannot be restored.

:::

**View Draft Version**  
Loads a previously saved draft version of a previously published model.

When, in the models summary list, you click a published version of a model for which a newer draft was previously saved, this dialog appears:

![Error dialog indicating editing must be performed on the draft version](../Images/Models/mdm-db-info-edit-draft-version_aadbbe2b-df61-4333-a258-485baba6baa3.jpg)

Action buttons are disabled until you click the dialog’s **Close** button.

**Cancel**  
Initiates a request to abandon the new draft model definition and return to the Models page. In the confirmation dialog:

 -   Clicking **OK** executes the operation.

 -   Clicking **Cancel** cancels the request.


**Close**  
Navigates to the Models page or, if there are unsaved changes to the model definition, initiates a request to navigate to the Models page. In the latter case a confirmation dialog opens:

-   Clicking **OK** navigates to the Models page without saving changes.

-   Clicking **Cancel** returns focus to the model page.
