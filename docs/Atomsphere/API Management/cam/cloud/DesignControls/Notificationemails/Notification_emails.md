Notification emails are sent to the developers when they register for a new key or when the API calls reach or cross a specific limit. Notification emails can also be sent to notify developers about their API usage. Notification email templates are associated with API Plans, thereby allowing you to provide custom notification to different API Plan users. 

The following table describes the fields on the Notification Emails page. 

|**Field**|**Description**|
| -------- | -------- |
|Email Template Set|Email template set name. |
|Defined templates|Number of templates defined in a template set. |
|Plans Using|Number of Plans that are using the template. |
|Last Modified|Date and time when the template set was last modified. |
