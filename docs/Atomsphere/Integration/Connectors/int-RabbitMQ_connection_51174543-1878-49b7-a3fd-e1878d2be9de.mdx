The RabbitMQ connection represents a single RabbitMQ account, including sign-in credentials.

If you have multiple accounts, use a separate connection for each account and configure the connector accordingly. Pair a single connection with a different RabbitMQ operation to perform unique actions on a RabbitMQ server.

## **Connection** tab 

The RabbitMQ connector uses the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol for authentication and authorization and provides basic authentication \(user name and password\).

:::note

All RabbitMQ connection fields are required.

:::

**User Name** - 
The associated user name with the RabbitMQ account. The user name specified in the connection also identifies the publisher of a message.

**Password** - 
The password of the RabbitMQ account is associated with the user name.

**Host** - 
Enter the IP address or domain name of the server that hosts the instance of RabbitMQ.

**Port** - 
Enter the port number that hosts the instance of the RabbitMQ service.

**Virtual Host** - 
The name of the RabbitMQ virtual host. To view a list of available Virtual Hosts on the RabbitMQ server, enable the RabbitMQ Management plug-in and navigate to the **Admin** menu.

**Use TLS** - 
Select if you are using the TLS \(Transport Layer Security\) protocol. It encrypts all data exchanged between and the server with a digital security certificate, which makes it difficult to steal your user name and password. You must import this certificate into . For more information, see the linked Certificate components topic.
