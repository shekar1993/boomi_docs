Integration simplifies process building without requiring you to write any code. To get started with building your first process, we recommend using the [Boomi Training and Certification](./int-Boomi_Training_and_Certification.md) portal to access self-paced tutorials to learn how to build, test, and deploy a process.

:::note

To access Boomi's training portal, you must have a Boomi Platform account. You can also log in with your Boomi Community credentials.

Building a process is as simple as dragging and dropping steps onto the Build Canvas:

For example, you can use Boomi to connect and automate an ordering process:
