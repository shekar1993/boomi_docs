The Stripe connection represents and contains all of the information that is needed to log in and connect to a single Stripe account.

If you have multiple accounts, you need a separate connection for each. You can pair a single connection with different Stripe operations to perform unique actions on a Stripe account.

## Connection tab​

The Stripe connector supports the usage of API keys for authentication and authorization.

- **Description**  
Base URL - The address is defaulted to the Stripe API Base URL : https://api.stripe.com/v1. 

- **API Key**  
Enter the unique API Key, obtained from navigating through Stripe Dashboard at Developers > API Keys.

## Test Connection​

You can test your connection settings before you use or save the connection in a process. The Test Connection ensures that your specified settings are correct, valid, and accessible. If the test connection is successful, you can save the connection. Otherwise, review and correct any incorrect settings, then test again.
