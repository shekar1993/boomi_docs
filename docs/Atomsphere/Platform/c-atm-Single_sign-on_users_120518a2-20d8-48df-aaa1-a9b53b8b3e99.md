# Single sign-on users

After setting up single sign-on on the SSO Options tab of the **Settings** page, administrators can add single sign-on users.

For users that already have credentials, the administrator only needs to add a federation ID. The userâ€™s email address cannot be changed because it is managed by the identity provider.

:::note

If a user attempts to sign in to the platform using SSO when they do not already have an account, an account is not automatically generated for them. An account administrator must first create their user account, add their user to an account, and then assign them user roles.
