The green line indicates successful process executions and the red line indicates process executions that resulted in errors.

All graphical data is not real-time data. Instead, the gadget displays a representation of aggregated data referenced in the two to three previous days. These graphs serve as an historical snapshot of the account \(or account group\) data.
