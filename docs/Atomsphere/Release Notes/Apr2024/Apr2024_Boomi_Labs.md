Boomi Labs features and fixes are not in the Runtime Release.

## Bundles

**We added these features:**

- With the sorting feature added to the **My Bundles** table, you can now sort the table data using the Bundle Name and Updated date. (UNI-2975)

- Enhanced the Bundle details table to have a Copy button icon in the header. This lets you copy the sharing URL for the Bundle, to share the public URL more easily. (UNI-3548)

- The Bundle Visibility setting dropdown was moved from the **Details** Tab to the **Sharing** tab. (UNI-3505)

- Enhanced the **Installed Bundles** table to have a column that displays the user-id (email address) of the user who installed the Bundle into your account. (UNI-3503)

- The Main **My Bundles** page now displays the user-id (email address) of the user who created the Bundle. (UNI-3502)

- We made minor changes to the message in the Bundle **Sharing** tab, which warns you when the Bundle is set to *Private*. (UNI-3616)

## Spaces

**We added these features:**

- We enhanced the Spaces **Run or Schedule a Process** screen with a confirmation pop-up to confirm that you intend to proceed with executing the process. When you press **Run Now** on the screen, a confirmation prompt displays, giving you the option to cancel or continue with the process execution. If you click **Continue Process Run**, the process starts execution. (OEMSPACES-21)

- The first **Schedule** and **Add Schedule** table prompts open by default in an expanded view to match the user experience with other prompts within Spaces to ensure the customer experience remains consistent. (OEMSPACES-22)

- We enhanced the **Schedule** design. (OEMSPACES-150)

  As part of this enhancement:

  - Existing schedules are initially collapsed

  - Existing schedules display at the top of the page and new schedules are shown at the bottom of the page

  - Any existing schedule expanded by you remains expanded even if you click on **Add Schedule** to add a new schedule

  - The **Add Schedule** button was moved to the top of the page

- We improved the Space Administrator Interface with enhanced pagination and sorting functionality in the all Spaces table, Space URL tooltip, and filename inclusion of an uploaded logo file. (CJ-2174, CJ-2175, CJ-2206, CJ-2238)
