## Benefits 

The Laserfiche integration with Boomi is helpful for:

-   Viewing a document or document metadata from Laserfiche and viewing or downloading it in another system, like a CRM, ERP, or any system with relevant documents stored within Laserfiche.

-   Saving a document to Laserfiche or updating Laserfiche metadata from another system. This action can be monitored to start a Laserfiche business process.

-   Gathering healthcare data. You can convert a Laserfiche document's metadata into the HL7 data format before sending it to a healthcare system requiring that standard.

-   AP Processing. The Laserfiche solutions for automating invoice processing can update necessary ERP and financial systems.


## Connector configuration 

To configure a connector to communicate with Laserfiche, set up two components:

-   Laserfiche - Partner connection

-   Laserfiche - Partner operation


This design provides reusable components, which contain connection settings such as username, password, and repository information. After configuring your connection and connector operation, you can use the connector operation within a process. When the Laserfiche - Partner operation is defined properly in your process, Integration can map to and from virtually any system using the Laserfiche - Partner connector to retrieve data from or send data to the Laserfiche application.

To use the Laserfiche - Partner connector, implement a connection from Laserfiche to Integration. To ensure the connection is successful, you must have the following:

**For Laserfiche Cloud**

-   A Laserfiche account with security permissions to create Service Principal Users and access the developer console

-   A Laserfiche repository \([Learn more](https://www.laserfiche.com/products/document-management/)\)
