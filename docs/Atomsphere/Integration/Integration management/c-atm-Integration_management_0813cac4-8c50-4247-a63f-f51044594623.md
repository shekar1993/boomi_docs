On the **Manage** menu you can view the results of process executions, troubleshoot process errors, administer Atoms, and execute processes manually.

Process activity from all Atoms within your account, whether hosted or deployed locally, can be monitored from this central console. You can view process logs, see how many records were processed, view actual document data, retry documents, and more.

The following menu items are visible on the **Manage** menu only if they are enabled in your account: Cloud Management, Boomi Assure, Process Library and Integration Packs.
