The account usage agreement enables administrators to communicate important information about an account when users sign in or switch to the account.

Account usage agreements can be used to outline acceptable account use guidelines, privacy statements, warnings, or associated information about an account. Administration users enable the agreement on the account and define the text to display. The agreement appears upon switching or signing in to an account, and requires users to acknowledge and accept these predefined guidelines before proceeding.

When a user declines acknowledgment of the agreement, the user is denied access to the account. For example, if a user signs in to the target account and declines the agreement, the user is signed out and redirected to the sign in screen. If a user switches into the account and declines the agreement, the user is returned to their default account.
