## Salesforce Platform Events connector

**We added this feature:**

- Allow the SFPE listen manager to use the Persisted Connector Cache to save and retrieve the `replayID` on send and receive actions when the **Enable Persisted Connector Cache** (`com.boomi.container.connector.persistence.enabled`) container property is enabled in the Advanced Properties section of the container properties. If the container owner is filtering out a specific set of connectorType values to use connector property persistence on runtime, then ensure that this connector is included. 

  This allows the SFPE connector to persist the `replayID` and start over from the point before the stop when pausing or stopping the listener.

  If the persisted `replayID` is invalid, the fail over is to the initial `replayID` mentioned in the connection. (CON-9496)

To learn more, see the topic [Salesforce Platform Events connector](../../Integration/Connectors/r-atm-Salesforce_Platform_Events_Connector_5be03def-3af7-4861-af94-b21d9ee79dfa.md).
