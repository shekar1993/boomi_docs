The **Flow Library** provides a library of example flows, page templates, and players that can be installed into your tenant.

The resources contained in the Flow Library provide you with quick access to best practice templates for common flow functionality, helping you to get started with creating your own flows.

Browse and install flows, page templates, and players from the Flow Library on the **Flow Library** page.
