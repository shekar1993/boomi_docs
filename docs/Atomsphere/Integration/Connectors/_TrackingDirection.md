**Tracking Direction** - Select the document tracking direction for the operation, either **Input Documents** or **Output Documents**. This setting enables you to choose which document appears in **Process Reporting**. Start steps always track output documents regardless of your selection.

:::note

If the tracking direction is read-only, the feature to change the direction is either unavailable or the developer set the configuration to read-only. The default value you see shows you which document appears in **Process Reporting**.
