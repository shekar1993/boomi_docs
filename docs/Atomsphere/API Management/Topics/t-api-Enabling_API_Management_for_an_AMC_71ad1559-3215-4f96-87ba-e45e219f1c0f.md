After you install the Gateway in API Management, use the **Shared Web Server** panel within Atom Management in Â Integration to set the **Authentication Type** to Gateway. If you still use an external authentication provider, then set the **Authentication Type**.

## Before you begin

-   You must have the Atom Management privilege to perform this task. If you have the Atom Management Read Access privilege, you cannot perform the task.

-   The API Management feature must be enabled for the account that owns the Atom, Molecule, or Atom Cloud.

## Procedure

1.  Within Integration, go to **Manage** \> **Atom Management**.

2.  Select the Atom, Molecule, or Cloud from the list on the left.

3.  In Settings & Configuration, click **Shared Web Server**.

4.  In the **API Type** list, select Advanced.

5.  If you selected a Cloud from the list and own the Cloud, click **Add Port**. Type a port number and set the **Authentication Type** to Gateway.

6.  Click **Save**.
