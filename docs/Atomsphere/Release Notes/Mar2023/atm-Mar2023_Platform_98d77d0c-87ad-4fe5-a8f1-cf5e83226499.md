## Unified sign-in 

Feature:

-   The unified sign-in experience enables you to use a single username and password to access both Platform and Flow. If you use two-factor authentication and have not already been prompted to do so, you must set up your authentication method again. The following features are no longer available:

    -   Backup codes for two-factor authentication

    -   Custom password policies

:::note

This feature does not apply if you authenticate with SAML SSO.
