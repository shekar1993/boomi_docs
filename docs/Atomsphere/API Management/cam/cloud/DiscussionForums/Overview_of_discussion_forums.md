Forums are a platform for effective and fast communication. They allow users to discuss ideas, solutions to issues faced, and effective ways to do certain things. You can use forums to share updates and changes in the areas that are being discussed or the areas on which you want to start a discussion. You can avoid confusion among the developers by sharing the latest and accurate information. Forum topic accessibility can be controlled by using moderation options. 

All user roles can access the Forum tab. Only the following user roles can add new Categories: 

- Administrator 

- Portal Manager 

To open the Portal from the Dashboard, click the **Portal** link on the top-right corner of the Dashboard. The forums can also be reached directly via the front-end developer Portal without accessing the Dashboard. 

For example, `http://developer.<company\_name>.com/forum`

:::note

The **Forum** tab is displayed on the **Portal** only when it is linked and enabled from the Dashboard. Under **Portal** settings, on the **Portal Setup** tab, in the **Primary Navigation** section, create a forum link. Select the **Enable Forum** check box in the **Forum** panel on the **Content** tab to enable the forum.
