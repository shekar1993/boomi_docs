MQTT is a publish/subscribe messaging protocol designed for lightweight machine-to-machine \(M2M\) communications that is a commonly-used connectivity protocol for Internet of Things \(IoT\) scenarios. This connector supports both publishing \(Send\) and subscribing to \(Listen\) an MQTT broker \(or server\).

Use the MQTT connector to integrate data to and from MQTT brokers, which manage data from devices and sensors with data from other sources accessible through the Boomi connectors.

## Connector configuration 

To configure a connector to use MQTT, set up two components:

-   MQTT connection — used to set authentication, certifications, and communication options.

-   MQTT operation — used to send data to brokers, or listen for data from brokers that is incoming from other clients.


## Supported editions 

The MQTT connector works with both v3.0 and v3.1.1 to send and receive messages from MQTT brokers.
