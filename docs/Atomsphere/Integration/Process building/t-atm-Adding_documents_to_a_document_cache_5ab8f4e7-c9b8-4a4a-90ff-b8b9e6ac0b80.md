Use an Add to Cache step to add documents to a document cache so that you can reference them later in the currently executing process or in a subprocess.

## Procedure

1.  Drag the **Add to Cache** step onto the process canvas.

The Add to Cache step dialog opens.

2.  Enter a display name for the step.

3.  Select or create a Document Cache component.

    Make sure that you select or create a Document Cache component that uses the same profile type as the documents being sent to the Add to Cache step.

4.  Click **OK**.
