The limits set at the Plan level can be overridden at the key level. The developers possess different levels of access to Services through different keys. It means that developers can set customized limits at the key level that do not affect the keys possessed by other developers. 

The following table illustrates how key limits are overridden at different levels. 

|**Limits set at** |**Can be overridden by** |
| ------- | ------ |
|**The Plan level (on the Plan page)** |The Key level (on the **Keys Details** page). |
