The Deployed Processes panel displays all deployed processes for the selected Atom, Molecule, or Cloud.

After selecting a process, you can edit its process properties in the **Edit Process Properties** dialog. You may want to change a process's properties or you may need to preset a property to a particular value when you are testing or troubleshooting a process and its resulting documents.

You can edit these types of process properties:

-   The date and/or time of the predefined properties `com.boomi.execution.lastrun` and `com.boomi.execution.lastsuccessfulrun`.

-   The property values of any process property components that you may have created. See the [Process Property Components](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Process%20building/c-atm-Process_Property_components_0b0a1f0f-d712-4087-a163-35dcdc214e7a.md) topic.

-   The property values of any dynamic process properties that you may have created. See the [Dynamic Process Properties](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Process%20building/r-atm-Dynamic_Process_Properties_3fe48a7a-039a-49b2-866f-60c9532c1ff9.md) topic.
