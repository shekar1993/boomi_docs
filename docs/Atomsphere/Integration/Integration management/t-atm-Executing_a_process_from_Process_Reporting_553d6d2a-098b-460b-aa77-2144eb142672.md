Manually execute a process from **Process Reporting** by selecting an Atom and a process.

## Procedure

1.  Go to **Manage** \> **Process Reporting**.

2.  Click the **Execute Process** button in the top-right corner of the page.

3.  In the dialog, select an Atom from the list.

    If you do not have an Atom installed, you are prompted to install one before continuing.

4.  In the **Process** field, click the magnifying glass icon.

5. **Optional:**  Click in the **Filter Processes** field and type part or all of a process’ name.

6.  Select a process from the list.

    Listener processes are not available in the list.

7.  Click **Execute**.

    A message indicates that the process is being executed. After the execution is complete, the results appear in the Executions section of the Process Reporting page.

    Execution results are displayed after the Platform receives them from the Atom. Depending on the complexity of the process, the volume of data, and varying internet connection speeds if the Atom is running in your local network, it may several minutes for results to be posted.

8.  Click the **Refresh** button or select **Auto Refresh Table** in the top-right corner of the page to see updated results each minute.
