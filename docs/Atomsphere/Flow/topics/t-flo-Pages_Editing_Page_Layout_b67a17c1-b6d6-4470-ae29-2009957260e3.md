You can edit an existing page from either the **Pages** page, or directly from a page map element in an existing flow.
Editing and saving a page impacts all page map components in the tenancy that utilise the page layout, so take care that your changes do not disrupt other processes.

1.  Click the **Edit Page** button on a Page map element within an existing flow.
2.  After editting the map element, click the **Save** icon in the right-hand menu to save and commit your changes to the page.
3.  Once you have saved your changes, the page is updated and these changes are reflected in any page map elements in the tenant that use the page.
