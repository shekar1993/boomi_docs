Define the golden record title format for a model in the **Record Title Format** tab in the model page.

## About this task


Golden record titles appear in stewardship pages as a convenience. A title format definition consists of selected fields and, optionally, static text strings, including spaces. You cannot add masked fields to the record title format.

## Procedure

1.  In the model page’s **Record Title Format** tab, select up to three fields to be included in the golden record title format by turning on their check boxes.

    The unique ID of each selected field appears in brackets below in the **Record Title Format** field. The **Sample Golden Record** box shows an example of the format in the context of a golden record detail view heading.

2. **Optional**:  To reorder the fields in the format, switch the **Record Title Format** field to **Tag View On** and then drag and drop the field tags.

3. **Optional**: To insert static text strings before, between, or after the fields in the format, switch the **Record Title Format** field to **Tag View Off** and type the strings.
