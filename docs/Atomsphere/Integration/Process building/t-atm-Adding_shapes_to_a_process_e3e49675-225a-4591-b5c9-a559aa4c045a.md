Processes contain a series of steps, represented by steps, that determine how data is run within the system. To add steps to a process, drag them from the steps palette onto the process canvas. 

:::note

Processes can contain a maximum of 250 steps and notes. If adding a step to the process can cause you to exceed the limit, you will receive a warning and you cannot paste the step into the process. See the Process step reference topic linked below to learn what each type of step does and how to configure it.

## About this task

You can add steps to your process in one of two ways. From the steps palette or from the inline builder.

## Procedure

From the steps palette:

1.  From the palette to the left of the process canvas, chose from the three step types **Execute**, **Logic**, or **Connect** to see the available steps.

1.  Choose your desired step and drag it on to the canvas.

    Your selected step is not visible on the canvas and can be configured.

From the inline builder:

3.  On the process canvas, click on the plus sign. This will show you a list of available steps and connectors you can choose from, along with recommendations based on previously used steps. When you use this method, steps connect automatically.

    The step will be automatically added and connected to your process. You can configure these by clicking the "Configure" icon under your step.

4. **Optional**: Type a name for the step or step in the **Display Name** field.

    The name appears below the step icon on the process canvas.

5.  Configure the step as needed.

8.  After you complete the dialog, click **OK**.

    The step appears on the canvas. If the step is missing a required configuration, you will see the icon ![!](../Images/main-ic-triangle-warning-yellow-16_a265c92a-c628-4a9a-a310-8f3d568c9a25.jpg) and the word **Configure** below the step.

9.  Repeat steps 1-5 to add more steps.

10. To reconfigure a step or to select a different component, do one of the following:

    -   Click the step’s icon.

    -   Pause on the step and click **Configure**

    -   Click the **Configure** link below the icon.

    The configuration dialog opens.

11. Configure the step, then click **OK**.

12. Click **Save**.
