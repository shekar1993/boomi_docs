A page can be deleted from CMS. After a page is deleted, it cannot be viewed on the Portal. A deleted page cannot be retrieved or restored. Default pages cannot be deleted; you can control their visibility using access control rules or change their status to Draft, for the purpose of hiding them from users in the Portal. 

:::note

The links to pages that are deleted become inactive. You must fix such links on the Portal if they are referenced through links in other content items.
