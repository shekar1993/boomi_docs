Partners can view the recipe submission progress through several stages: Draft, Awaiting Approval, Action Needed, and Published. Each stage represents a specific phase in the review and publication process, helping to understand precisely where your submission stands at any given time.

|   Status | Description   |
|:--:|:---|
| Draft   |   Submission creation happens in this initial stage. Partners make necessary edits and updates to each submission step to ensure the details are complete before submitting for review. |
| Awaiting approval   |  Boomi admins review and provide feedback or approve the submission during this stage.  |
|  Action needed  | If Boomi Admin determines the submission requires additional changes, it moves to the Action needed stage. In this phase, the admin rejects the submission until you update it with the necessary modifications.   |
|  Published  |  The final stage occurs when Boomi  Admin publishes the submission to Boomi Discover. This stage signifies the successful completion of the submission process and the availability of the asset to users. |
