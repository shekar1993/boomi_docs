You can remove the API Control Center Users on the **Organization Control Center Users** page. When you remove users, the association between the roles and the user is deleted. The roles continue to exist in the Organization. For example, if John is an API Manager of Heavy Industry and the Organization Administrator removes John from Heavy Industry. Then John will be deleted from Heavy Industry, hence John is no longer the API Manager of Heavy Industry. But the API Manager role continues to exist. 

:::note

Only the users are removed from that Organization. If the user belongs to multiple Organizations, there is no impact on the user roles in the other Organizations.
