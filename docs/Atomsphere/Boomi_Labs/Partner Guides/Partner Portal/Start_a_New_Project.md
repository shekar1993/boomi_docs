Partner Portal enables you to build projects that meet your requirements through an easy-to-use interface. Each asset you create using the partner portal initiates a new project. When you start building a connector, you kick off a new project. Similarly, when you start a recipe project, that action initiates another distinct project. Each asset you developâ€”a connector, recipe, AI agent recipe, etc.- counts as a separate project. 

Create your project by selecting the relevant use case. Each use case features a guided journey to facilitate seamless development and publishing using the integration canvas or other Boomi core services like Boomi Flow, Master Data Hub, and B2B/EDI Management. Upon meeting the Boomi standards, the admin publishes your created assets as follows:

* Connectors to Boomi Enterprise Platform 
* Recipe and AI Agent Recipe to Boomi Discover 
* Community articles to Boomi Community portal
