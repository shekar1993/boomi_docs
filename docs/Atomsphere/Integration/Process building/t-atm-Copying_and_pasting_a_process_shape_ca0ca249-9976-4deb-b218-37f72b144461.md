The capability to copy and paste steps helps you streamline process building. You can either copy and paste just one step at a time or multiple steps.

## Procedure

1.  To copy one step, point your cursor at the step or click the step itself. To copy multiple steps, click and drag a rectangle around the steps that you want to copy.

    Depending on what you chose to copy, a button bar appears above a single step, or a transparent rectangle appears on the canvas, with a button bar displaying the number of selected objects \(steps and notes\).

2.  Click the **Copy** button.

    A message indicates that the step or steps have been copied.

    :::note

    Start steps cannot be copied because each process can have only one Start step.

    :::

3.  Do one of the following:

    -   Click the location on the process canvas where you would like to paste the step\(s\) and click **Paste**.

    -   Open a different process, click the location on the process canvas where you would you like to paste the step\(s\), and click **Paste**.

    The step or steps are pasted to the new location.

    :::note

    Processes can contain a maximum of 250 steps and notes. If pasting a step into the process causes you to exceed the limit, you receive a warning and you are not be able to paste the step into the process.

    :::

4. **Optional:**  Repeat the previous step to paste the process step\(s\) to an additional location.

5.  Click **Save** or **Save and Close** in each process that you changed.
