A process is comprised of a series of steps, represented by steps, that dictate how the process retrieves, manipulates, routes, and sends data from source to destination. steps can be connected together in endless combinations to build simple to very complex integration work flows.

Each step has its own set of configuration options. The configuration often references other components such as profiles, maps, connections, and operations.
