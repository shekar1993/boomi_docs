The **Domains** page allows you to add domains. Use the **New Domain** button to add a new domain. The Domain name is required to be able to enter input data for a new Endpoint. 

:::note

A newly created Domain is displayed with waiting status until it is approved by API Management Support.

The following table describes the fields on the Domains page. 

|**Field** |**Description** |
| -------- | -------- |
|Domain Suffix|The domain list. Only the suffix part of the domains is required while adding new domains and only that part is displayed in this list. For example, the domain name sample.domainname.com can be entered as domainname.com. |
|Status|The status of the domain. The status indicates whether the domain can be used while creating endpoints. When the domain is added, its status is waiting. After API Management approves the domain, the status is changed to active. |
