The Boomi Master Data Hub (legacy) connector connects seamlessly with repositories. It uses web service calls using XML request and response profiles over an HTTPS connection. Technical details of the connection, such as request headers, error handling, HTTPS connection, and so on, are all abstracted from the user to simplify the implementation.


:::info

This connector is available only for existing integrations. For new integrations, use the [Boomi DataHub connector](docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Connectors/int-Boomi_Data_Hub_connector.md), which offers more operations and an improved experience.
