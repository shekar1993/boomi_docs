## Changelog

**2024-05 (Version 24.05.0, Current)**

- Five new dynamic operation properties: **CorrelationId**, **ReplyTo**, **To**, **ScheduledEnqueueTimeUtc**, **ReplyToSessionId**. The existing operation properties have been updated to be dynamic tool. (CON-8862)

- Vulnerability issue of type Denial of Service was resolved to make the connector more secure. (CONC-2794)

- The Listen operation will utilize the domain name specified in the connection to avoid operation failure. This fix may not be backwards compatible with previous domain names. (CONC-1614)

- Namespace and domain names with invalid characters (i.e. â€˜/, *, ?') will return a relevant error message instead of a NullPointerException. (CON-2638)

- Necessary runtime packages are now packaged with the connector. (CONC-2823)

- The **entityName** operation field for the Receive operation is now overridable. (CON-9451)

- The **Entity Type** dropdown box was moved above the **Allow Dynamic Entity Types** (formerly **Allow Entity Type Override**) checkbox in the import operation to allow for dynamic operation properties. (CON-8982)

- Overridable fields now include Access Token parameters, Authorization parameters, and Extended JWT Claims (if supported by the connector).
