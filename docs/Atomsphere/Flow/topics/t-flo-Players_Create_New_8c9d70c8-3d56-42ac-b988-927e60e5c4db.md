You can create a new custom player to completely suit your flow user interface requirements.

The default player provides a useful base from which you can begin creating your own custom players. Customizing players gives you complete control over the user interface for your flows.

1.  Open the **Players** page.
2.  Click **New**.
3.  The **New Player** dialog is displayed.

    -   **Name**: Enter a name for the new player.

    -   **Base on**: Select the existing player that will be used as a starting point for the new player. For example, select the default player to pre-populate the new player with the default player code, ready for you to edit.

4.  Click **Save**.
5.  The new player is created and displayed on the page.
6.  Edit the player as required.
