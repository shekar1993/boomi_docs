For more information about creating a Pricefx operation, see the topic [Creating an Operation](int-Creating_an_Operation_bc324fb1-3e09-481c-9151-dd828b77125d.md).

## Options tab

Click **Import Operation**, then use the Import wizard to select the object to integrate. When you configure an action, the following fields appear on the **Options** tab.

**Object** - 
An object defines what you want to integrate or the action to execute, which you select in the Import Wizard.

<TrackingDir />
<ReqRes />
<ReturnErrRes />

**Last Import Version** - 
The connector version when the operation was last updated.

**Metadata** - 
These read-only values describe the meaning of each attribute.

## Query

This operation retrieves records from the Pricefx Partition, optionally based on a filter. When executing a QUERY, you must provide pagination information. You can set the pagination values using the following document properties:

**Page Number** - 
Required. You can only view the results of a specific page, which can be configured in this property.

**Page Size** - 
Optional. The default page size is 500; you can set it to any number smaller than the default. When querying an object, you must configure query parameters. Below rules are applied to the parameter value:

-   0 arguments are required for "Is Null" and "Not Null".
-   Comma-separated arguments are required for "In", "Not In", "Between", "Between inclusive".
-   1 argument is required for all the other operations.

## User Access Operation

This operation provides actions relevant to authentication and authorization such as updating user access and getting a JWT token. Below actions are supported:

-   **Update Business Roles** - This action allows you to update the business roles of a user. When updating business roles, you must provide the unique key of the role to update. You can set the unique key using the following document property:

    -   Unique Key required.
    -   The login name of the user for which you would like to update the business roles.
    When updating business roles, you must provide the request message in JSON. The message consists of two arrays:

    -   The “Add” array contains all the new business roles to be added.
    -   The “Remove” array contains all the existing business roles to be removed.
-   **Update User Groups** - This action allows you to update user groups of a user. When updating user groups, you must provide the unique key of the user to update. You can set the unique key using the following document property:

    -   Unique Key required.
    -   The login name of the user for which you would like to update the user groups.
    When updating user groups, you must provide the request message in JSON. The message consists of two arrays:

    -   The “Add” array contains all the new user groups to be added.
    -   The “Remove” array contains all the existing user groups to be removed.

-   **Update Roles** - This action allows you to update roles of a user. When updating roles, you must provide the unique key of the role to update. You can set the unique key using the following document property:

    -   Unique Key required.
    -   The login name of the user for which you would like to update the user roles.
    When updating user roles, you must provide the request message in JSON. The message consists of two arrays:

    -   The “Add” array contains all the new roles to be added.
    -   The “Remove” array contains all the existing roles to be removed.

-   **Get Token** - If the **Use JWT Token**” option is selected in connection, you must first get the token by this operation and use it in other operations. The token can be stored into the database cache and can be shared by all the processes. The database here should be maintained by the user, as it is outside Pricefx. Document cache is not suitable as the cache would not remain active throughout multiple process executions. The token generally expires in 30-40 minutes and it should be refreshed periodically before it expires. The “Get Token” process can be deployed and executed as a separate process running periodically to refresh the stored token in the database. During token refresh, connectors in other running processes using the previous token will return the 401 application error code if **Return Application Error Response** is not selected, or “login failure” message if **Return Application Error Response** is selected. A retry mechanism to get the new token from the database should be implemented. Another approach, if possible, is to schedule all these processes not to run during the time when the token refresh process is executed in Atom Management. After getting the token, you must provide the token to all other operations. You can set the token using the JWT Token document property.
-   **Logout** - This operation is generally not required as logging out means that the token will become invalid and all other processes using the same token will be getting an authentication error. Use this only when you are using username / password authentication and the process is not frequently executed.

## PA - Truncate Data

This operation truncates Price Analyzer data from the Pricefx Partition, optionally based on a filter in the request message. When truncating a Price Analyzer table, you must provide the request message in JSON.

The JSON schema is imported automatically and is the same for truncating any Pricefx Price Analyzer tables. The truncate request is built using filters. If one record is to be truncated, the filter could be, for example, “name” “equals” “0001”. To find out the supported operators in the request message, refer to [Pricefx documentation - Supported operators in criteria](https://pricefx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/3725984086/Appendix+Supported+Operators+in+Criteria).

## PA - Data Upload

This operation uploads data in Excel file format to a Price Analyzer table in the Pricefx Partition. When uploading data to a Price Analyzer table, you must provide the request in a binary file stream. The file must be an XLSX file and the maximum size is 1 MB. It can be provided to the connector via the Disk connector. The first row should be column headers.
