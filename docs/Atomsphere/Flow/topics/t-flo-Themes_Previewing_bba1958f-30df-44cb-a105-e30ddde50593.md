Themes provide a no-code alternative to Players for customizing Flows. You have the ability to customize the design elements contained within any flow such as fonts, background color, border and so on.

## Overview

Adding customizations to a Flow formerly required modifying a Player and executing the Flow. Themes eliminates the need to manually edit HTML code by providing a user interface for the most common customizations.
