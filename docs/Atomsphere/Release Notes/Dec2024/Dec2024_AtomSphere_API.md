We've transitioned our Boomi Enterprise Platform API documentation from help docs to a new Swagger-like format on Boomi's [Developer Documentation](https://developer.boomi.com/) website. This modern, interactive experience offers detailed specifications, examples, and enhanced navigation to simplify integrations.

With clearer guidance and better usability, this new format accelerates development, reduces onboarding time, and drives faster product adoption across teams. Check it out now!
