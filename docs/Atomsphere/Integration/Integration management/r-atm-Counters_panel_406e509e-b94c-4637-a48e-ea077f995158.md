If your account owns a local Atom, Molecule, or private Atom Cloud, you can view and reset its counters on this panel. If your account has access to a private Atom Cloud, you can access the account’s counters on this Atom Cloud.

The Counters panel appears on the Atom Management page (**Manage** \> **Atom Management**).

:::note

You must have the Atom Management privilege to reset the counters for an Atom, Molecule, or Atom Cloud. If you have the Atom Management Read Access privilege, you can view the counters but you cannot reset them.

:::

All of the counters can be reset to an integer greater than or equal to one \(1\) and less than or equal to 2,147,483,647. Numbers must be entered without commas.

The counters that you see here are stored in the Atom, Molecule, or Atom Cloud’s `<installation_directory>/counter/<counterFileName>` file. Although you can edit the counters in this file with a text editor, recommends editing the properties in this panel instead.

Counters are system-defined or created by the user as Sequential Value map functions or parameter values.

- **Counter Name** - Name of the counter.

- **Value** - The count.
