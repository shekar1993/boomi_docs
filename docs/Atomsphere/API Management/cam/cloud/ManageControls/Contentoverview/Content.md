The Content tab allows you to add, modify, or delete Portal content such as API documentation, blog posts and custom HTML pages. The Content tab is referred to as the Content Management System (CMS). It has a built-in WYSIWYG editor that is enriched with formatting tools similar to any word processing program, but can also accept HTML directly. The preview option displays how the content would look like after it is published to the Portal. The content can be viewed by visitors on the Portal only after it published. A separate style sheet and JavaScript can be customized and added to every page, thereby providing specific look-and-feel and even functionality. You can add role-based permissions to control who can view the pages using the **Advanced Options** tab, as described in [Setting Advanced Options](Setting_advanced_options.md). 

The following user roles can access the Content tab: 

- Administrator 

- Content Manager 

- Portal Manager 

- Program Manager 

The following content types can be created in the CMS: 

- [Custom Pages](Creatingcontent/Creating_custom_pages.md): The Custom Pages section contains custom HTML pages, such as marketing or promotional content as well as important API-related information not intended for traditional API documentation. The Portal’s home page is also included here. Custom pages can be created and published in the CMS. 

- [Documentation](Creatingcontent/Creating_documentation_pages.md): API documentation is created and published in the CMS. When the documentation pages are created, they are listed in the **Documentation** section on the Dashboard. These pages can be accessed from the navigation panel of the **Documentation** tab on the Portal.
 
- [Blog](Creatingcontent/Creating_blog_posts.md): The **Blog** section contains the blog pages that are created in the CMS. When the pages are published, they can be viewed on the **Blog** tab on the Portal. 

:::note

If the links are not created for the blogs, docs, or custom pages, users cannot view the tabs for the respective categories on the Portal. You can create the navigation links in the **Portal Setup** tab on the Dashboard.
