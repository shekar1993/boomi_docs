Processes contain a series of connected steps, represented by steps. Connecting two steps is a drag-and-drop operation, or by clicking on the connecting icon that originates from the source step.

## Procedure

1.  Hover over the green arrow ![green arrow icon](../Images/main-ic-arrow-red-right-16_8e34c6c7-eb83-460c-9cfc-2b8ade694997.jpg) originating from the source step. The green arrow shows a plus sign. ![Plus sign icon](../Images/img-int-plus-sign-in-shape_b46cfaa2-ffb5-468d-9dd0-37198fd3e440.jpg)

2.  Click on the plus sign to view and select from the list of available steps.

    After connecting the steps, the arrow turns green.

3.  To add additional inline steps, repeat step 2.
