Use the Process Reporting page to search for information about process executions and their related documents and logs. Process reporting stores logs for 30 days by default. If you want a longer retention policy, you must contact Boomi to change the configuration.

When you open this page (**Manage** \> **Process Reporting**), by default displays all deployed processes that ran in the account within the past hour.

The Process Reporting page has filters that you can use to:

- Find process executions, documents, or trading partner documents.

- Find test mode executions.

- Find processing results that occurred within a specific time frame.

- Find processing results based on specific criteria. For example, you can find process executions that ran on a particular Atom. The filters vary, based on whether you are searching by process execution, document, or trading partner document.

- View all, failed, pending, or successful process executions or documents.

The processing results from all Atoms within your account \(whether hosted or deployed locally\) can be monitored from this page. After you find the desired processing results, you can:

- View process and document logs for deployed processes

- View process execution documents and the actual data for deployed processes

- View information about documents that encountered errors

- Use Boomi Resolve to troubleshoot errors

- Rerun documents for a deployed process

- Export processing results to a CSV file

On the Process Reporting page you also can select and execute a deployed process.
