The following information identifies the new features and enhancements in Flow:

**Features**:

-   Added a new option in the Page Builder screen, `Component Suggest`, under the Components menu, that allows you to select a value and identify the most suitable component to display the chosen value on the page through intelligent recommendations. \( FLOW-5790\)
-   Themes offers a non-coding option for personalizing flows, serving as an alternative to Players. You can tailor all design components within a flow, including colors, fonts, background color, borders, and more. \(FLOW-5775\)

    **Important:** You will need to turn ON the **Themes** toggle on in your **tenant** page settings.
