**We fixed these issues:**

- Inadvertently clicking on the canvas no longer looses configured step changes. (INT-4527)
- Default values for Process properties now display correctly and retain their value when the allowed value is a comma-separated string, when navigating away from the page, when updates are made, and when it is deployed. (INT-8321)
- Switching between tabs in the process canvas no longer condenses steps to one side. (INT-9791)
- Import of referenced components, contained in process libraries, no longer pick up edits that happened after process library packaging. (INT-10042)
