Published processes most commonly serve as templates for the building of new processes. Building a process using an installed process as a template is simpler in most cases than building a process from scratch.

The **Browse Process Library** dialog, which is accessible from the **Build** page, lets you install published processes in your account. The processes in the Process Library were either published by or published to account groups of which the account you are using is a member. When you install a process, the process component and all of its dependent components are copied into your account. \(Passwords are not included in the dependent components.\) Once you install a process, you can open it in the process canvas and edit it.

Process publishing is performed in a primary account. After a process is published, the user administering the process library shares it with selected account groups that they manage.
