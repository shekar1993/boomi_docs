Spaces are collections of shared Integration Packs that can be used to install, configure, schedule, and run integration processes. If your account includes Spaces, you can create Spaces for your internal teams or customers so they can install, configure, and quickly get started with Integration.

Spaces are intended to make it easier for your team or customers to quickly install and configure integration processes, reducing the time and effort required to manage integrations at scale.
