Deploy packages to a runtime environment from the Packaged Components page \(**Deploy** \> **Packaged Components**\) or the Deployments page \(**Deploy** \> **Deployments**\).

In order to deploy a component, such as a process or API service, you must first create a packaged component version of it. Creating a packaged component allows for a consistent version number that can be deployed across different environments. Only after a version of the packaged component is created can you continue with the deployment process. See our topics about Packaged Components by visiting the Related Links section.

After creating a packaged component, you can deploy the component to one or more environments. You deploy packaged components and manage existing deployments from the **Deployments** page \(**Deploy** \> **Deployments**\). In addition to deploying packaged components, you can:

- Review the list of actively deployed packages
- Review a package's deployment history
- Quickly deploy a packaged component to a second environment
- Revert a deployed packaged component to another version
- Compare two active deployments against one another
- Copy the components within the deployment to the Build tab's Component Explorer
- Undeploy a deployed package

A date filter of **Past Week** is applied to the list by default. You can change the date filter or clear it.

:::note

You must have the Packaged Component Deployment privilege to deploy packages and manage existing deployments.
