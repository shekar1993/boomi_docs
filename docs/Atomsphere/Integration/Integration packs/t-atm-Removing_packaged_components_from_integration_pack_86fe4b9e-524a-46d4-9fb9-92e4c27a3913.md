From the **Integrations Pack** page, remove published components from an integration pack to ensure the component is not included in a new release of the integration pack.

## Procedure

1.  In the Integration Packs page, select the integration pack.

2.  In the Packaged Components list, select the packaged component that you want to remove and click **Remove package** ![main-ic-trashcan-black](../Images/main-ic-trashcan-black_e2f838cf-803f-4985-8c03-43bc7f3dfa06.jpg).

    A confirmation dialog opens.

3.  Click **OK**.

    The package remains in the Packaged Components list, but “Deleted” appears in the **Pending Package Version** column to indicate the package will not be included in a new release of the integration pack.

4.  To restore the deleted package, click **Undelete** in the **Pending Package Version** column.

    The "Deleted" label is removed and the pending packaged component version is redisplayed.
