**We added these features:**

- We enhanced the token management in your environments settings. With this improvement, you can manipulate the name, expiration date, permissions/authorizations, and description of your tokens in one of two ways. 
  1. Via the API, where you can now CREATE new tokens, EDIT existing tokens, and DELETE tokens. 
  2. Via the UI, where you can create new tokens and search for tokens to edit/update or delete.
