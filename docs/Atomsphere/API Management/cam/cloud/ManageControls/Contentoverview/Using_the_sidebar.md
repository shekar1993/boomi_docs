# Using the Sidebar

  <meta name="guidename" content="API Management"/>

The Sidebar can be used in the custom pages to include URLs or add text to be displayed on the Portal. The Sidebar can be set as left-aligned or right-aligned by modifying the CSS file.

:::note

Every Boomi Cloud™ API Management Portal uses a default CSS that can be customized. You must go to the **Portal Setup** sub-tab under the **Portal Settings** tab. The code for the sidebar can be customized using the inline CSS or by making changes to the `.css` file and uploading it to the File Manager. After uploading the file to the file manager, you can use the CSS in your Portal. Alternatively, you can contact API Management Support to customize your Portal Skin.
