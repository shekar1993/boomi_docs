You can expand an element in an XML profile to access child elements and attributes.

## Procedure

1.  Open an XML profile.

2.  Click the blue arrow ![icon](../Images/main-ic-arrow-blue-down-16=GUID-CA79043B-869E-4C8B-A46E-5D4D4FA1DBEE=1=en-us=Low_ee257e3c-4362-486e-b1f1-4d613b679c4c.jpg) next to an element ![Three blue building blocks.](../Images/main-ic-box-three-blue-16_492ab85c-6ce0-4dee-8d70-fe96386b828b.jpg) or ![Three yellow building blocks.](../Images/main-ic-box-three-yellow-16_fb1578cf-d17a-4d09-883a-b4cc8ff20398.jpg) that references a type that has child elements and/or attributes.

3.  Select **Expand Element**.

    After expanding an element, you cannot collapse it.

    The elementâ€™s child elements and attributes appear in the tree. Now they are available in the XML profile and can be used in a map.

4.  If the expanded element has child elements, they are not expanded along with the parent. Repeat step 3 as needed to expand these child elements.

5.  Click **Save**.
