Eclipse is an open source integrated software development environment \(IDE\). provides an Eclipse plug-in that simplifies the building and packaging of connectors.

**Important:** The Eclipse plug-in is still available for download and use. However,  does not maintain or support it and plug-in updates are not provided. If you use Eclipse as your IDE,  recommends that you import the connector project as either a Gradle or Maven project. For more information, see the topic [Setting up the connector development environment](https://developer.boomi.com/docs/Connectors/GettingStartedWithConnectorDevelopment/Setting_up_connector_development_environment).

The Boomi Connector SDK Tools plug-in for [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) provides the following benefits:

-   lets you quickly set up Eclipse projects for your connectors.

-   assists in the editing of connector configuration and descriptor files.

-   automates the packaging of connectors for uploading to your account.


To use the plug-in, you must first download and install it in Eclipse and then set the preference that specifies the path to your Connector SDK installation. After completing these setup tasks, you can create your first Eclipse connector project. An Eclipse project contains source code and related files for building a Java application.
