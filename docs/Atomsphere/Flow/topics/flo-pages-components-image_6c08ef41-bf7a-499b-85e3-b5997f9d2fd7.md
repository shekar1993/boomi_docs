Add a standalone image into your page.

## Overview

Although you can add images into your page layouts using other content components such as a presentation or step component, the image component allows you to add a single, standalone image as a separate component.

The image is shown in the page builder component.

## General settings

The following options and settings can be configured.

|Setting|Description|
|:------|:----------|
|**Name**|Enter a name for the image. The image `<ALT>` tag uses this value.|
|**Label**|Enter a label for the image. The image label is displayed above the image by default. Do not enter a label if you do not require this text to be shown.|
|**Image URI**|Enter the full URI to the hosted image that you wish to display in the page. Images can be added to the assets library. See [Assets](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/c-flo-Assets_7d21c82d-c700-437d-bdaa-ae4b0716726b.md).|
|**Width**|Enter the width of the image in pixels.|
|**Height**|Enter the height of the image in pixels.|
|**Help information about this component**|Display help text directly below the component, for example to provide further information on how to use the component.|

## Styles

Apply additional CSS styling to the component.

1.  Enter space-delimited CSS classes/selectors into the **CSS Classes** field.

When you run the flow, these classes are appended to the main component class. See [CSS reference](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/r-flo-CSS_Reference_d32122b8-0f11-47be-91c6-6986575f933e.md).

## Attributes

Add attributes to the component.

1.  Click **Add Attribute**.
2.  Enter a supported attribute **Key** and **Value**. See [Attributes reference](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/r-flo-Attributes_Reference_4f153424-8c52-4e24-b289-2d961f0b9830.md).
