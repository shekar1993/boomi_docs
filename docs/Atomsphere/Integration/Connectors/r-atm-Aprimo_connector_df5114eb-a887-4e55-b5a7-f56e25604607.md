The Aprimo connector enables you to move data into and out of Aprimo Marketing Studio On Demand.

As an Aprimo user, you can use to integrate any on-premise applications and legacy systems. The Aprimo connector connects directly to Aprimo Marketing Studio On Demand and browses the interfaces in real-time. The integration with Aprimo Marketing Studio On Demand uses HTTP to post XML documents to resource URLs. The technical details of this connection such as request headers, error handling, HTTP connection, and so on are all abstracted to simplify the implementation.

-   Aprimo connection

-   Aprimo operation


## Prerequisites 

The Aprimo connector requires the following:

-   An Aprimo Marketing Studio On Demand account with a user name and password.

-   Private and public keys for the Aprimo siteâ€™s base URL.
