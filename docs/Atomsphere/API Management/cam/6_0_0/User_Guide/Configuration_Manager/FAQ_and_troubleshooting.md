|**Question / Issue** |**Answer** |
| ---------- | -------- |
|The user interface Save or Cancel does not respond. |Check if the server is running on the port that is used in the browser URL. The server must be running at the configured Configuration Manager hostname /admin. |
|How do I create multiple endpoints with the same path but different HTTP methods? |<p>The business rule is: No two endpoints can have the same domain, path and method combination. But at creation time, the methods cannot be manipulated. So the workaround is to create an endpoint with a different path, change the methods and then revert the path for the endpoint. </p><p>The workaround to create multiple endpoints with the same path but with different HTTP methods are provided below, and uses the following two example endpoints with these details: </p><p>- Endpoint 1 - http://api.example.com/hello (Method: Get, Post) </p><p>- Endpoint 2 - http://api.example.com/hello (Method: Put, Delete) </p><p>**Workaround:**</p><p>1. Navigate to Home > API Definitions. </p><p>2. Create a New API Definition. </p><p>3. Enter the name 'sample API' and save the API Definition. </p><p>4. Navigate to Endpoints. </p><p>5. Click New. </p><p>6. Enter the following details for Endpoint 1: </p><p>&emsp; - Name: EP1 </p><p>&emsp; - Published EP Domain: api.example.com </p><p>&emsp; - Published EP Path: /hello </p><p>&emsp;- Origin EP Domain IP/Address: localhost </p><p>&emsp;- Origin EP Path: /hello </p><p>7. Click Save. </p><p>8. Navigate to **Home > API Definitions > sample api > Endpoints**. </p><p>9. Create a second endpoint with the following details: </p><p>&emsp;- Name: EP2 </p><p>&emsp; - Published EP Domain: api.example.com </p><p>&emsp;- Published EP Path: /hello\_temp </p><p>&emsp;- Origin EP Domain IP/Address: localhost </p><p>&emsp;- Origin EP Path: /hello </p><p>Note that the Published EP Path is /hello\_temp. This is temporary. </p><p>10. Save the details for Endpoint 2. </p><p>11. Navigate to the Protocol and Authentication tab in the sidebar for EP2. </p><p>12. Select checkboxes for Put and Delete and unselect boxes for Get and Post. </p><p>13. Save the changes. </p><p>14. Navigate back to the Endpoint Settings tab for EP2. </p><p>15. Change the path from /hello\_temp to /hello. </p><p>16. Save the details. </p><p>This gives you two endpoints with the same path but different methods. </p>|
|How are out-of-the-box HTTP Client Profiles set up? |The cluster admin must configure the identity and stores using the cluster manager CLI. Once they are added via that tool, the identities and trusts should show up in the admin UI immediately. You can then map the identities and stores to the newly created HTTPS Client Profiles that can then be used for endpoints. |
|How does the admin setup identity and trust profiles? |<p>Certificates and Identities can be created from Configuration Manager. The API designer can choose to make the endpoint secure using HTTPS. When a client (for example, a browser) makes a request for a secure endpoint, the Traffic Manager forwards the request to the internal backend endpoint. </p><p>The backend can be one-way authenticated or can expect the client (Traffic Manager in this case) to perform mutual authentication. </p><p>This can be done in two ways: </p><p>1. One-way authenticated backend endpoint. </p><p>&emsp;In this case, the backend's CA cert is compared against the known Truststore. </p><p>2. The mutual authentication scenario performs the server validation that point #1 covers but also expects the client to be authenticated by the server. </p>|
