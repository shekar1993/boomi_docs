After an API is created, you can create, modify, and delete endpoints associated with the API on the **Endpoints** page. While you are viewing or creating endpoints, you can access the API related settings by using the navigational tabs on the left pane of the page. 

The API name, version, date and time when the API was created are displayed on the page. For more information, see [Creating an Endpoint](Creating_an_endpoint_manually.md).
