## Connector configuration

To configure the connector to communicate with the UBIX platform, set up two components:

-   UBIX Advanced Analytics - Partner connection

-   UBIX Advanced Analytics - Partner operation


This design provides reusable components, which contain connection settings and operation settings. After building your connection and connector operation, you need to set up your connector within a process. When your connector is configured properly within your process, Integration can map to and from virtually any system using the UBIX Advanced Analytics - Partner connection to transfer data into UBIX DataSpace to utilize advanced analytics and artificial intelligence tools.

## Prerequisites

-   To implement a connection to your UBIX account from Integration, have your UBIX Base URL, App Key, and App Secret, and ensure that the permissions are successful. The UBIX Base URL, App Key, and App Secret are obtained during UBIX sign-up.

-   Prior to transfer, data needs to be in JSON format.

    :::info Important

    It is recommended to use UTF-8 to encode input JSON data to preserve special characters and ensure the operations work properly.
