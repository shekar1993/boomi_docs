The Partner [Submissions](https://platform.boomi.com/BoomiLabs.html#pub_submissions;accountId=tppdemo-TLLOQT/tab=pending) tool serves as a self-serviced, automated tool that enables Boomi Technology Partners to submit their assets (For example, Recipe, AI Agent Recipe) for review and approval by Boomi admins. This tool allows partners to interact efficiently with the Boomi team and publish the assets on Boomi Discover. The streamlined process allows partners to submit assets swiftly and with minimum manual intervention. The tool also enables partners to monitor the status of their submissions in real-time and take appropriate action as necessary. 

Boomi admins use the Submissions tool to provide feedback to Partners, enabling collaborative refinement of the asset. Once the review process ensures the asset meets Boomi standards, admins approve and publish it on Boomi Discover.


## Prerequisitesâ€‹

You must be an active Boomi Technology Partner to use the Submissions tool. If you are not yet a Tech Partner and wish to become one, visit the [Technology Partner Program](https://boomi.com/partners/technology-partner-program/) (TPP) page to learn about our program.

## Accessing Submissions tool

After you become a Technology Partner, you can access the Submissions tool. Log into the [Boomi Enterprise Platform](https://platform.boomi.com/), then select **Submissions** under **Labs** to begin managing your submissions.

## Getting started with the Submissions tool

On the first login, as the admin, you must update the publisher details on the settings page, including the publisher name, company details, and logo, and invite your team members who need access to the Partner portal. Updating the publisher details enables the **Start New Submission** button on the Submissions UI to begin submitting a new asset.

Partners see the Home Page displayed on successive logins with all created submissions and their status.
