Before installing the Atom on Linux, ensure that your computer meets system requirements and you synchronize clocks.

Complete the following prerequisites, then install the Atom on Linux.

## Check Atom system requirements 

Check the [Atomâ€™s system requirements](./r-atm-Atom_system_requirements_e3656558-174d-438e-bc5a-6dd48d20c159.md).

## Synchronize clocks 

Ensure that the Atom's server clock, including central storage services (such as NFS), synchronize regularly. You can use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server.

## Install the Atom 

After you complete the preceding prerequisites, complete the following tasks in order.

1. Download the Atom installer.

2. Install the local Atom on Linux.

3. (Optional) See the section about maintaining Atoms, Molecules and Atom Clouds. You can modify how the Atom runs, change default settings or even remove it.
