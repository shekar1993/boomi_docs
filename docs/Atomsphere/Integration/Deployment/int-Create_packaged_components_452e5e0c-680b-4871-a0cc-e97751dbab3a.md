Creating a packaged component is the first step in deploying components.

Processes and components must be converted into a packaged component before they can be deployed or shared, either in the Process Library or as part of an integration pack.You create an individual "package" per component. However, a packaged component can consist of a primary component and all the dependent components that are required to support that component. For processes, API Service components, and Processing Group components, a packaged component might include connectors, maps, or process properties.

For other deployable components (such as certificates or custom libraries), the component comprises the packaged component by itself.

You can create a package from:

- The **Build page**, while the component is open and saved
- The **Packaged Components page** in the **Deploy** menu
