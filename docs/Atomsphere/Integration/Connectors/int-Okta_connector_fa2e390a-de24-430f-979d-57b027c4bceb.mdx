The Okta connector allows you to interact with an Okta account, to leverage Okta's REST APIs to easily provision and manage users.

The Okta Identity Cloud provides secure identity management with single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, life cycle management \(provisioning\), and more. The Okta connector makes it easier for Boomi customers to provision Okta users, groups, and group management \(add, update, delete users to groups\).

:::note

This is an open source connector and you can access the code in the [Okta](https://bitbucket.org/officialboomi/okta) connector repository.

## Connector configuration

To configure the connector to communicate with Okta APIs, set up two components:

-   Okta connection — Represents a specific Okta instance and its associated user authentication details.
-   Okta operation — Represents an action against a specific Okta instance \(object type\).

## Prerequisites

To connect with Okta's APIs, you must have an Okta account. First, [sign up and create an Okta developers account](https://developer.okta.com/code/rest/). Once you have the unique Okta subdomain and API Token, you can connect to Okta APIs.
