The connection contains the configuration required to physically connect to an application or data source. This usually includes user name, password, URL, host name, IP address, port, etc. Simply put, a connection is one connection endpoint to a database, application, or API for use in an integration process created within the Boomi Enterprise Platform.

Connections are used in connector steps of course, but also in Program Command steps, Map functions, Decision steps, and Operation and Profile wizards.
