The Flow interface is designed to provide quick and easy access to all areas of the application.

## Navigating Flow

Navigation is commonly performed by clicking on menus, tabs, links, buttons and icons:

- Click on an item in the left-hand menu to access each of the main areas of functionality.
  
- You can expand/collapse some menus by clicking on the arrow icon situated at the top of the menu. For example, you can expand the main left-hand menu to show the names of each menu item next to each icon.
  
- You can see your flows on the **Flows** page. Other feature pages are displayed in a separate tab when opened. Click on a tab to select and open a page.

 :::caution

 Take care when using your browser's **Back** or **Refresh** buttons, as this can refresh or close components that you are configuring, before you have saved your changes.
