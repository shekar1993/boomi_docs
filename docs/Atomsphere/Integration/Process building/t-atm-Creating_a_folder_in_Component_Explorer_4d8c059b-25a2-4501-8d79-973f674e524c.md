You can create hierarchical folders in Component Explorer to organize groups of components.

## About this task

You can create new folders within existing folders only. For example, the folder is primary. When you create a new folder, it appears on the next level as the secondary. Also, you can create folders inside the secondary folders.

## Procedure

1.  Select the folder in which you want to create a folder and click the blue arrow ![icon](../Images/main-ic-arrow-blue-down-16=GUID-CA79043B-869E-4C8B-A46E-5D4D4FA1DBEE=1=en-us=Low_ee257e3c-4362-486e-b1f1-4d613b679c4c.jpg) next to it.

2.  Select **New Folder**.

    If a folder has write restrictions on it and if you are not assigned a user role that allows write access to the folder, this option is not available.

    The New Folder dialog opens.

3.  Type a name for the folder and click **OK**.

    The new folder inherits the folder permissions of its parent.
