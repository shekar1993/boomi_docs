View logs to research where a process failed and why.

Viewing logs and understanding the information contained in them is an important part of building, testing, and monitoring processes. Logs can help you research where a process failed and why. While the process executes in Test mode, you can watch the progression of documents through the process steps. When the test is finished, you can view the log and data files produced.

:::caution

The log and data files produced during a Test mode execution are temporary! When you exit Test mode, this information is lost.

:::

There is a limited number of messages generated when you run a process in Test mode.
