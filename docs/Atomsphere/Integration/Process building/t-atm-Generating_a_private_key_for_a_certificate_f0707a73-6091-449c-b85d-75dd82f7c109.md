If you have a private certificate for which you did not generate a private key at the time of the certificateâ€™s creation, you can generate the private key later using the Generate Private Key Wizard.

## Procedure

1.  On the **Build** page, open an existing private certificate.

2.  Click **Generate**.

    The Generate Private Key Wizard opens.

3.  Enter the required information for the X.509 or PGP certificate.

4.  If you are generating a private key for an X.509 certificate, you must set a password.

5.  Click **Finish**.

    The certificate details are displayed on the tab.

6.  Click **Save**.
