2.  Do one of the following:

    -   Drag a step from the steps palette onto the canvas.

    -   Click an existing step in the process to display its configuration window.

3.  At various points you may see an icon for creating a new component. Click **![icon](../Images/main-ic-plus-sign-white-in-green-circle-16_4dc8c5f3-e893-4aef-ade2-0b7afe9476c1.jpg) Create a new component**.

    The component opens on a new tab.

4.  Type a name for the component.

    The maximum length is 255 characters.

5.  Type a description.

6.  Configure the other fields as needed for the component.

7.  Click **Save** or **Save and Close** to save the process containing the new component.

## Next Steps

If you create a process or deployable component and are ready to deploy it, after clicking **Save**, click the **Create Packaged Component** button. The Create Packaged Component wizard opens. Complete the steps in the wizard and click the **Deploy** button on the final confirmation message. Your component appears in the list of packaged components on the **Deploy** > **Packaged Components** page. It also appears in the list of deployed components on the **Deploy** > **Deployments** page.
