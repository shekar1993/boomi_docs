You can open and edit existing types from the **Types** page.

:::caution

Editing and saving a type will affect all flows in the tenant that currently use the type, and care should be taken to ensure that your changes do not adversely affect these other flows. If you wish to edit a type created as part of a installation, this can only be performed via the API - see [Editing Types](t-flo-Types_Editing_Service_Type_ada54795-7afa-4de7-ab42-6ecf82b8ed84.md). System types cannot be edited - see [System Types](r-flo-Types_System_d5418044-1ac0-4d01-9485-5ebd06ab7f8e.md).
