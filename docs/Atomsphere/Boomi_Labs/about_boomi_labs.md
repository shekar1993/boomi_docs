Boomi Labs is a hub designed for Boomi builders to centralize building, managing, and sharing of assets across Boomi. It is a centralized area that enables and encourages builders and developers to build and explore Boomi. Boomi Labs creates a workbench for building on Boomi by centralizing tools for partners to explore and create assets for publishing.

Boomi Labs provides access to the following Interfaces to promote building, sharing, and publishing:

**Spaces**<br />
Spaces are portals that contain a collection of shared integration packs that can be used to install, configure, schedule, and run integration processes. Spaces are designed to help manage platform usage at scale. To learn more, refer to [Spaces](/docs/Atomsphere/Spaces/spa_Getting_started_483fcb89-ef04-449c-b02f-b0dd64692974.md).

**Bundles**  
 Bundles are solution templates that are created by grouping one or more Boomi assets, such as Integrations and Flows, to share with other accounts. To learn more, refer to [Bundles](/docs/Atomsphere/Bundles/bundles_Getting_Started_with_Bundles.md).

**Integration packs**   
Integration packs are pre-defined integrations and consist of one or more packaged processes or API Service components that are ready for installation by users of managed accounts. To learn more, refer to [Integration Packs](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Integration%20packs/c-atm-Integration_packs_73e9b46d-050f-4491-a0bc-dee09949dfa8.md).

**Process library**   
Process libraries are published processes that have been packaged and marked as shareable. To learn more, refer to [Process Library](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Integration%20management/r-atm-Process_Library_page_1fe3f73c-a4a0-4ec2-a750-0485dfb5a181.md).
