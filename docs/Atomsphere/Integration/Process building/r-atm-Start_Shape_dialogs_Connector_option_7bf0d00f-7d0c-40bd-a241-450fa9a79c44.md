The Connector option is the default and most common option for a Start step. This setting allows you to define an inbound action to bring documents into a process. This option requires that you select a connector from our library.

For some of the application connectors, a unique request message must be sent to the application to bring documents into the process. These cases require defining parameters within the Start step to build this initial request message.
