The Add Staging Area for Source operation requests the addition of a staging area for a source attached to a universe \(domain\) hosted in a repository under an account accessible to the authenticated user. The source must be a contributing source for which Initial Load is either enabled or finished. The staging area status is obtainable with a Get Staging Area Status request.

To perform this operation, send an HTTP POST request to

`https://api.boomi.com/mdm/api/rest/v1/<accountID>/repositories/<repositoryID>/universes/<universeID>/sources/<sourceID>/stagingArea/create`

:::note

This operation requires the authenticating user to have the MDM - Source Attachment privilege in addition to the API Access privilege.

You can implement requests for this operation in processes using the [HTTP Client connector](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Connectors/r-atm-HTTP_Client_connector_d64af80e-febe-4cd2-89ad-e3d0fc53c502.md).

:::

The body of the request must conform to the following structure:

```xml
<mdm:CreateStagingAreaRequest xmlns:mdm="http://mdm.api.platform.boomi.com/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <mdm:name></mdm:name>
    <mdm:id></mdm:id>
</mdm:CreateStagingAreaRequest>
```

where

-   `<mdm:name>` sets the name for the new staging area â€” maximum 255 characters. Each source attachment's staging area's names must be unique.

-   `<mdm:id>` sets the ID for the new staging area. The maximum length is 50 characters, and the allowable characters are uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, underscore \(\_\) and hyphen \(-\). Each source attachment's staging areas IDs must be unique.


## Path parameters 

**accountID**

**repositoryID**
