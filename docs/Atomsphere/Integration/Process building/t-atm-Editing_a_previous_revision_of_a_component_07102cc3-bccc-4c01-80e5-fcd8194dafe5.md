You can edit a previous revision of a component by clicking the **![icon](../Images/main-ic-pencil-green-16_51e497cb-8c52-461c-a470-9584aaae44e6.jpg) View/Edit Revision** icon for that revision in the Revision History dialog.

1.  In the Component Explorer, navigate to the folder containing the component.

2.  Double-click the component.

    The component opens on a tab.

3.  Click the **Revision History** icon.

    The Revision History dialog opens.

4.  Click the **![icon](../Images/main-ic-pencil-green-16_51e497cb-8c52-461c-a470-9584aaae44e6.jpg) View/Edit Revision** icon next to a revision number.

    The older revision of the component opens on a new tab with a banner indicating the revision number.

5.  Make changes to the component as needed.

6.  Click **Save** or **Save and Close**.

    Saving older revisions of a component will overwrite the latest revision. Any component references, child components, or subcomponents will be to the latest revision of those individual components. This is important when you are configuring older revisions of a process or map that contains one or more child components.
