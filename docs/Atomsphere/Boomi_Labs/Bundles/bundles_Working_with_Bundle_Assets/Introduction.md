**Assets** are the various objects you can add to a Bundle, such as Integration, Flow, and Custom Assets. 

Types of assets: 

* **Flow** - Created in Boomi Flow, a cloud-native, low-code application development platform for creating customer journeys and automating simple, sophisticated workflows that accelerate your business.

* **Integration** - The integration asset enables you to share **Packaged Components** with the user of the Bundle. Packaged Components are “snapshots” of the Integrations you have built.

* **Custom Assets** - Custom assets include supporting files such as documentation, READMEs, and sample data to help you get started with the Bundle.
