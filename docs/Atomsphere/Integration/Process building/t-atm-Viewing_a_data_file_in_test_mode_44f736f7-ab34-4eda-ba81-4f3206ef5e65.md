You can view the source document and tracking information that was sent into a step.

When you are in test mode, the Start step and all Connector steps have a Connection Data tab that displays inbound or outbound documents, any connector-specific tracking information, and the ![](../Images/main-ic-document-with-magnifying-glass-16_36098f7c-7a65-41a5-8392-a2e729d3de91.jpg) **View Source** link to view the actual data contents.

All steps other than the Start step contain a Step Source Data tab. You can view in the Document Viewer dialog the source document that was sent into this step. This view is helpful, for example, when reviewing the source data of a map or the request data sent to an outbound connector.

1. Click the **Start** step or a **Connector** step on the process canvas.

2. Select the document from the numbered list in the **Documents** window.

3. Click the **Connection Data** tab.

4. On the Connection Data tab, click the **View Source** icon to open the document in the Document Viewer Dialog.

5. On the process canvas click **one of the steps** that is not the Start step.

6. Select the document from the numbered list in the **Documents** window.

7. Click the **Step Source Data** tab.

8. On the Step Source Data tab, click the **View Source** icon to open the document in the Document Viewer Dialog.
