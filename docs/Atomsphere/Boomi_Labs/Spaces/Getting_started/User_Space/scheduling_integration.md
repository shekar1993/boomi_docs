After installing an integration, you can schedule processes to run at a designated time. It is also possible to add multiple schedules.

To add a schedule:
1. Click **Schedule** in the **Action** column.
2. Select the desired Schedule Type from the drop-down and define the appropriate fields:
    * Minutes
        * Interval - Select a time interval ranging from 00 to 59 for the process to run.
        * Start Time and End Time - Select a time range from 00 to 59 minutes.
    * Hour 
        * Interval - Select a time interval ranging from 00 to 23 for the process to run.
        * Start Time and End Time - Select a time range from 00 to 23 hours.
    * Day
        * Start Time - Select an hour of the day the Schedule would start.

3. Select Day(s) to Run - Select the days of the week you want this process to run.

4. Click **Save** to finish.

    Once scheduled, the Schedule status changes from **Not Scheduled** to **Scheduled**.

    You can edit the existing schedule by changing the configured Schedule properties. When editing, the system displays the last scheduled time for the respective process for the selected schedule type. 

    To delete a schedule, click **Delete Schedule**.
