## Download a file (Deprecated)

:::note

This operation is deprecated and has been replaced by the newer **Download** operation. It remains in the Files.com - Partner connector to provide backwards compatibility for customers who used the previous version of the connector in their processes.

:::

This operation will retrieve the contents of the specified file. This applies to any file on Files.com, including Remote Mount files stored on supported platforms such as Microsoft \(Azure Blob, Azure Files, SharePoint, OneDrive\), Amazon S3, Google \(Cloud and Drive\), BackBlaze B2, Rackspace Cloud Files Storage, Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage, any remote FTP site, any remote SFTP site, Box, and Dropbox.

When creating a new Files.com Connector Operation, select a Connection component, then select the Connector Action for **Download a file**, and select a Connector Operation component.

When creating a new Connector Operation component, select the **Import Operation** button, and use the Import Wizard to complete the import, and a file object, with an unstructured Response Profile, will be created for you. The **Download a file** action does not create a Response Profile.

After the operation import, the following Parameters will be available for the connector step:

- ID: (Required) The path to the file. This should be the full absolute folder path including the file name and file extension.

The response result will be the contents of the file, which can used in subsequent steps of your Boomi process.

## List folder items (Deprecated)

:::note

This operation is deprecated and has been replaced by the newer **List** operation. It remains in the Files.com - Partner connector to provide backwards compatibility for customers who used the previous version of the connector in their processes.

:::

This operation will list the contents of the specified folder/directory path on the Files.com platform. This applies to any folder on Files.com, including Remote Mount folders from supported platforms such as Microsoft \(Azure Blob, Azure Files, SharePoint, OneDrive\), Amazon S3, Google \(Cloud and Drive\), BackBlaze B2, Rackspace Cloud Files Storage, Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage, any remote FTP site, any remote SFTP site, Box, and Dropbox.

When creating a new Files.com Connector Operation, select the Connector Action for **List Folder Items**.

Select the Import button, use the Import Wizard to complete the import, and a Response Profile will be created for you.

The **Per Page** option of the operation can be used to limit the returned results to the number of items specified.

Under the Filters tab, click on the triangle icon next to **Filter** and select **Add expression**. Select **Expression**, select the **Field** option, and choose **path**. Select an Operator option from either **Equals** or **Wildcard Match**.

-   The **Equals** option will configure the operation to expect a path value that will be matched exactly.
-   The **Wildcard Match** option will configure the operation to expect a path value that includes a filename wildcard pattern to be matched.

For example, to list the entire contents of a Files.com folder named /vendor/acme/orders, use a **Filter Expression** with an Operator of **Equals** and add a Parameter to your step that has a value of `/vendor/acme/orders`.

To list only the \*.csv files of a Files.com folder named /vendor/acme/orders, use a **Filter Expression** with an Operator of **Wildcard Match** and add a Parameter to your step that has a value of `/vendor/acme/orders/*.csv`.

Each item in the results will be passed on as a separate document to your Boomi process.

The Response Profile for each item, represented as a JSON dictionary, will include the following output keys and values:

| Key | Value Format | Description |
