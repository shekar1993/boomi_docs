You can move a component by dragging and dropping it to a different location in Component Explorer, or using the Move Component function in the Folder Details for a given component.

## About this task

To manually drag and drop components to a new folder in Component Explorer, use steps 1-2. To quickly move a component to a new folder using Folder Details, use steps 3-4.


## Procedure

1.  In the Component Explorer, navigate to the folder containing the component.

2.  Click the component, drag and drop it to another folder.

    If the destination folder is valid, the folder's name is highlighted in green. If the source folder or the destination folder has write restrictions on it and if you are not assigned a user role that allows write access to those folders, you receive an error message and the component does not move.

3.  Alternatively, open a component on the Build page and click **Folder Details** at the top of the opened component.

4.  Under **Move to Another Folder** in the Folder Details dialog, choose a folder in the hierarchy and click **Confirm Move**.

    Moving a component in this manner saves any changes you may have made to the component. You are prompted to confirm a final time before the component is saved and moved.

    You can create and select a new folder location when copying and moving folders and components. Click the plus \(+\) symbol to create a new folder.
