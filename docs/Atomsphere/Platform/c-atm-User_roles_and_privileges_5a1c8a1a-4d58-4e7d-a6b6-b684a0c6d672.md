User roles and the default privileges assigned to each role are described in this table.

A Boomi Enterprise Platform user corresponds to a unique email address that can be given direct access to one or more Boomi accounts. A role is assigned to a user to enable a list of privileges. A privilege is a right reserved to a role that allows a user to access or perform actions in a specific area of the Boomi Enterprise Platform.

Boomi Enterprise Platform includes several user roles and many privileges. The Boomi Enterprise Platform roles are: Administrator, Standard User, Production Support, and Support. If these roles do not meet your needs, your administrator can create custom roles for your account.

| Privilege | Description | Administrator Role | Standard User Role | Production Support Role | Support Role |
