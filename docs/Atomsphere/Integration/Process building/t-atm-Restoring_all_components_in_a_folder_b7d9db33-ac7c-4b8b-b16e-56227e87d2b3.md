If you know the location in which you stored the deleted component, and if the folder in which the deleted component was stored is still visible in the Component Explorer, you can navigate to that folder and restore the component.

## Procedure


1.  On the **Build** page in the Component Explorer, navigate to the folder that contains the deleted component\(s\).

2.  Click the **![icon](../Images/main-ic-arrow-blue-down-16=GUID-CA79043B-869E-4C8B-A46E-5D4D4FA1DBEE=1=en-us=Low_ee257e3c-4362-486e-b1f1-4d613b679c4c.jpg)** blue arrow next to the folder.

    The ![icon](../Images/main-ic-disk-blue-restore_1138446d-263c-4517-a433-628953e6dfef.jpg) **Restore** icon appears on the menu if the folder contains one or more deleted components.

    If the folder in which the component is stored has write restrictions on it and if you are not assigned a user role that allows write access to that folder, this option is not available.

3.  Click **Restore**.

    This restores *all* deleted components in that folder. If the folder contains sub-folders containing deleted components, clicking Restore restores *all* of the sub-folders and *all* of the deleted components within the sub-folders.
