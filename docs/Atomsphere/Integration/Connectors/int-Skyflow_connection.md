## Test Connection

You can test your connection settings before you use the connection in a process or even before you save the connection. Test Connection ensures that the connection settings that you specify are correct, valid, and can be accessed. If the test connection is successful, you can save the connection. Otherwise, review and correct any incorrect settings, then test again.
