The Cancel Channel Updates operation, cancels a Propagate Channel Updates request specified by its ID.

## Basic authentication

To perform this operation using Basic auth, send an **HTTP DELETE** request with an empty request body to:

`https://<host>:<port>/mdm/universes/<universeID>/sources/<sourceID>/records/updates/<requestID>`

where:

*host* is the host name or IP address of the repository and port is the port number of the shared HTTP server as configured in the accountâ€™s [Atom Management settings](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Integration%20management/c-atm-Atom_Management_b38a3a90-d7f6-4df0-8c00-e75a178dfdfa.md).

## JWT authentication

To perform this operation using JSON Web Token (JWT) auth, send an **HTTP DELETE** request with an empty request body to:

`https://<host>:<port>/mdm/universes/<universeID>/sources/<sourceID>/records/updates/<requestID>?repositoryId=<repository ID>`

You must have the following MDM privileges:

- **MDM - Source Management**

:::note

You can implement requests for this operation in processes using the [HTTP Client connector](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Connectors/r-atm-HTTP_Client_connector_d64af80e-febe-4cd2-89ad-e3d0fc53c502.md).

:::

This operation is applicable to a request with a status of SUBMIITTED or PROCESSING. You can obtain the status using a Get Channel Updates Status request.

## Path parameters 

**universeID**  
ID of the universe

**sourceID**

**requestID**  
ID of the Propagate Channel Updates request. You can obtain this ID from the response body for that request.

## Query parameters 

**repositoryId** <br></br>
ID of the repository. Case sensitive. Required with JWT authentication only. You can obtain the repository ID from the URL after navigating to the repository in the user interface.


## Responses

         currently exist for universe '257e5d32-4e8c-4a6c-8869-42c5a09eab91' and

  </error> 
  ```

- 404 (Not Found) *sourceID* does not identify a source attached to the specified universe. Sample response body:
