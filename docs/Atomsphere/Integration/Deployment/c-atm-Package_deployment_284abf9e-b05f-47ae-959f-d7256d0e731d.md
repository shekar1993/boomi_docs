Deployment is the means by which you move your packaged processes and deployable components into a runtime environment.

After you package a process or component, you are ready to deploy that package to one or more environments. You deploy packages and manage existing deployments from the **Deployments** page (**Deploy** > **Deployments**). In addition to deploying packages, you can:

- Review the list of actively deployed packages
- Review a package's deployment history
- Undeploy a deployed package


:::note

You must have the Process Deployment privilege to deploy packages and manage existing deployments.

:::

As you review the list of active deployments, you can use filters to display:

- Everything that is deployed to a specific environment
- Everything that was deployed within a given time frame
- Everything that was deployed by a specific user
- Everywhere that a given package is deployed
- Everywhere that packages with a specific user-defined version ID are deployed


:::note

A date filter of **Past Week** is applied to the list by default. You can change the date filter or clear it.
