-   Events are displayed as separate rows in the **Events** table. ![Step 1](../Images/img-flo-Step1_ed936f88-97de-4cc1-98ac-9f351a84a1bb.png)

    The table is sorted so that the most recent events are displayed first. Information for each event is displayed in the table log as rows. In addition to individually recording the identity, user entries, and action of the user, the event log provides the date and time that the events occurred. For instance, creating, updating, or modifying any record.

-   The **Duration** field allows you to change the **Events** table results by selecting a duration, like:

    -   Day
    -   Last Month
    -   Last 3 Months
    -   Last 6 Months
    -   All
    Selecting Day will update the table of events to show only events that had occurred on a certain day. ![Step 2](../Images/img-flo-Step2_c61b5577-5d61-4de6-9cfd-7eb5f4587ce0.png)

-   The **Date** field allows you to change the **Events** table results by selecting a different date. Selecting a different date will update the table of events to show only events that occurred on the selected date. ![Step 3](../Images/img-flo-Step3_80c92964-4950-401a-b366-9af635fc20e7.png)
