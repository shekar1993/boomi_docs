## Deployments of the API Product

Each tile represents a deployment of the API Product. The tiles are grouped according to production environments and non-production environments.

The left-hand side of the tile contains the color and the shortcut of the environment in which the deployment is located. Similar to the pinned environments in [Environments](../Topics/cp-Environments.md) . On the right-hand side of the tile, in addition to the display name of the environment, you will also see the ID of the gateway.
