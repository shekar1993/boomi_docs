## Test Connection

You can test your connection settings before you use or save the connection in a process. The Test Connection ensures that your specified settings are correct, valid, and accessible. If the test connection is successful, you can save the connection. Otherwise, review and correct any incorrect settings, then test again.


:::info Attention

You can only run the Test Connection against containers associated with your account (local Atoms, Molecules, and Atom Clouds).
