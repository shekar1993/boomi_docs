## Amazon SQS connector

**We have fixed this issue:**

- Necessary runtime packages are now packaged with the connector. (CONC-6400)

To learn more, see the topic [Amazon SQS connector](../../Integration/Connectors/r-atm-Amazon_SQS_connector_a018e9b9-7d51-4f2b-9b6f-8ada84475f6c.md).

## Boomi for SAP connector

**We added this feature:**

- A new operation: LISTEN

  - It allows the connector to browse WebSocket EDA subscriptions, build response profiles, and connect to corresponding WebSocket servers identified through browse. It supports JSON and XML schemas.
  
  - Once connected, the connector listens to any message sent to the subscriptionâ€™s receiver. It then processes this message and submits the result to downstream processes. If the connection fails, one error is submitted, and an indefinite retry loop is started. (CON-9646)

:::info Important

SAP will send events to the WebSocket server regardless of listening connectors; the event may be lost if no connector is listening.

## Eyer - Partner connector

**We added these features:**

- Consolidated all operations into a single operation, controlled with parameters.

- Added multi-tenancy support

(CON-9647)

## Hadoop connector

**We have fixed this issue:**

- Necessary runtime packages are now packaged with the connector. (CONC-5855)

To learn more, see the topic [Hadoop connector](../../Integration/Connectors/r-atm-Hadoop_connector_33d08b80-8f21-46e0-9440-6e87e47d8714.md).

## MongoDB connector

**We have fixed these issues:**

- The connector has improved exception handling. (CONC-3450)

- Memory usage optimization for Get and Query operations. (CONC-5540)

- This is an enhancement to the MongoDB connector to support Azure CosmosDB MongoDB variant for Get and Query operation by addressing the default 1MB document size limit restriction. Maximum document size can be controlled via new container property - `com.boomi.connector.mongodb.maxDocumentSize`.

- For Cosmos DB `com.boomi.connector.mongodb.maxDocumentSize` should be set to less than 1, in this case the size limit restriction of the document will be removed. (CONC-6001 and CONC-5400)

To learn more, see the topic [MongoDB connector](../../Integration/Connectors/int-MongoDB_connector_a6cce0aa-00a6-48d0-bfbe-feb2474b57e1.mdx).

## RabbitMQ connector

**We have fixed this issue:**
