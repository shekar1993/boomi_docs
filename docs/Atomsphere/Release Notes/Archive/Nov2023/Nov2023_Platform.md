**We added these features:**

- The Boomi GPT home page has a new look and two UX enhancements. Youâ€™ll notice:

  - You can click tiles with prompt examples to help you start your conversation.
  - The Boomi AI icon appears in the top right in Settings, Integration, Master Data Hub, API Management, Event Streams, and Bundles, allowing you to access Boomi GPT from multiple screens in the Platform.
