Azure Data Lake Storage \(ADLS\) connector enables you to access and interact with your ADLS Gen2 storage using the ADLS Gen2 REST APIs.

The Microsoft ADLS connector's connection represents a single account including login credentials. If you have multiple systems, you need a separate connection for each. The connector supports the OAuth 2.0 authentication type.
