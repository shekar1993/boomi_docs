Organization Administrators can invite other users to become an Organization Administrator.

## Adding an Administrator to an Organization

To add a new Administrator, an existing Organization Administrator must first invite the user.

1.  An Organization Administrator initiates the process by sending an invitation to a user.
    1.  Click **Invite User** in the **Administrators** section of the **Organization Settings** page. The **Invite a user to become an administrator of this organization** form is displayed.
    2.  Enter either the user email address or their unique user ID \(e.g. 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'\).
    3.  Click **Send Invite**.
    4.  The user receives an email invitation. The **Users with pending or rejected invitations** table on the **Organization Settings** page updates to display the pending invitation. If required, click the **Delete** icon to delete an invitation \(if it has not yet been accepted\).
2.  Once the user receives an invitation, they can either accept or reject the invitation. See [Joining an Organization](flo-Organizations_Joining_Organizations_e0bf8f6d-9d07-49ae-8496-302a2926d4d2.md).
    -   If the user accepts the invitation, their user account is added to the **Current Administrators** table on the **Organization Settings** page.

    -   If the user rejects the invitation, their user account is added to the **Users with pending or rejected invitations** table on the **Organization Settings** page. If required, click the **Delete** icon to acknowledge and remove the rejected invitation from the table.
