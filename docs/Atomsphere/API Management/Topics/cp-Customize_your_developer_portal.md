The Boomi API Control Plane offers two different approaches for customizing the Developer Portal:

1. In-Platform Customization:

     a. You can use the content management system (CMS) of the existing developer portal to customize it for your requirements.
     
     b. To customize these elements, please follow this instructions section of the user-guide: [Content Management System (CMS)](../Topics/cp-Content_management_system.md) 

2. Frontend Source-Code Access

     a. If you wish to go beyond the built-in customization options, we provide access to the corresponding GitHub project, allowing you to make further adjustments on your own.
     
     b. By accessing the GitHub project, you can modify the portal's layout according to your specific requirements.
