The API tool provides a client interface for interacting with Boomi Flow API endpoints from within the software.

Although Boomi Flow developers can interact directly with API endpoints and functionality using any API tool of their choice, the API tool provides an API client interface already fully integrated within the tooling. Boomi Flow API endpoints are pre-populated and accessible from within the tool.

The API tool can be accessed on the **API tool** page. See [API tool page](c-flo-APItool_page_a5cfaf7e-2c60-499b-957c-272def76dc79.md).

-   Authentication of API requests made using the API tool is handled automatically in Boomi Flow by pre-populating the relevant authorization parts of the request for you.

-   You can interact with the API endpoints using the standard GET, POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP methods. The JSON data responses from the API are shown within the tool in the **Response** pane.

-   To get started with using the API tool, see [Making API requests using the API tool](c-flo-APItool_using_8a620c2a-753f-4eb9-9457-d67931336d2f.md).

-   A full list and description of the API endpoints can be found in the Boomi Flow developer [API reference documentation](https://manywho.github.io/docs-api/).
