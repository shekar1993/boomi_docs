The OpenManage Enterprise connector allows you to connect to DELL Open Manage Enterprise \(OME\) and use a process to query Alerts \(based on ID, SeverityType and Timestamp filters\) in DELL OME and receive output data in JSON format.

The OpenManage Enterprise connector enables accessing data in your OME system and sharing that data out with other systems. The robust filtering options let you selectively choose alerts based on specific criteria \(ID, SeverityType, Timestamp\).

## Connector configuration

To configure the connector to communicate with OME, set up two components:

-   OpenManage Enterprise connection
-   OpenManage Enterprise operation

This design provides reusable components containing connection settings and operation settings. After building your connection and operation, set up your connector within a process. When the process is defined properly, Integration can map to and from virtually any system using the OpenManage Enterprise connector to communicate with DELL Open Manage Enterprise \(OME\).
