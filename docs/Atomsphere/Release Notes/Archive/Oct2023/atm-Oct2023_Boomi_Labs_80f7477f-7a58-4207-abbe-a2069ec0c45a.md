## Spaces

**We fixed these issues:**

- Users are now redirected to Platform for re-login when they get logged out of Platform while using the Spaces User Interface and Platform in the same browser. (CJ-1779)

- We have enhanced the utilization of cookies for the Application. (CJ-1692)

- Logo files (.svg) greater than the recommended size (200X50) now get rendered on the Spaces User Interface. (CJ-1777)
