The UBIX Advanced Analytics - Partner connection represents and contains all of the information that is needed to connect your UBIX account to the Boomi Enterprise Platform. If you have multiple UBIX accounts, use a separate connection for each and configure the URL, App Key, and App Secret accordingly. You can also pair a single connection with different UBIX Advanced Analytics - Partner operations to perform unique actions within a single UBIX - Partner connector account.

## Connection tab 

The UBIX - Partner connection uses access keys, which consist of URL, App Key, and App Secret. Create these tokens using the Integrations section in the UBIX DataSpace product. After you create them, assign the proper permissions for the integration to work. Once you've created the tokens, configure the connection in the Boomi Enterprise Platform using the URL, App Key, and App Secret by entering their values in the appropriate fields.
