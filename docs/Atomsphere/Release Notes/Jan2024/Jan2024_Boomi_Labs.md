**We added these features:**

* **Connector Developer** menu option is added to the **Boomi Labs** drop-down. This enhancement will enable you to easily access the **Connector Developer Portal** from the Platform masthead. Note that this option will only be available to those who have user access to the Developer Portal. (UNI-2217)

* **Publisher Settings** button is added to the upper right of the **Boomi Labs** page for Admin users to easily set the Publisher details. (UNI-3246)

## Bundles

**We added these features:**

* You can now disable Bundle UI using the **disableBundleUI** account feature. If the account feature is enabled, the Bundle UI menu in the masthead takes you to the **Learn More** page for Bundles. In this case, the Bundles menu is not visible in the Publisherâ€™s UI tab. If the account feature is disabled, then the Bundle UI menu in the masthead takes you to the Bundle UI app. (UNI-3401)

* **Create a New Bundle** page is enhanced with the **Viewed** tab, and you can now access the previously viewed Bundles on the new tab. (UNI-3240)

* **Installed** Bundles table is enhanced by disabling the **Install** button for deleted Bundles.  If the Bundle owner deletes the installed Bundle, the Bundle name is still visible on the page with the disabled install button. (UNI-3355) The table is also enhanced with the sort functionality. (UNI-3464)
