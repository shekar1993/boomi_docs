Once an active subscription has been verified and API Management has seen an entitlement call come through, the status for a plan changes to a green check mark, you can use the **Publish this API** button to publish your API. 

## Procedure

To publish the API Marketplace listing:

1. From the **API Marketplace** page, click on the listing in the **Package Name** field to open the **Listing Details** page, then click **Publish this API** on the top right corner of the page. 

   :::note
   
   You could also navigate to either the **Listing Details** or **Plans** page, and click **Publish this API** on the top right corner of the page. 

   :::

   If the required prerequisites have not been completed, you will not be able to publish the API. 

2. A pop-up window is displayed, warning that you cannot make any changes to your listing once it is published. Click **Publish this API** to continue. 

## Result

Once your listing is published, you can no longer delete dimensions, the listing, the package, nor its plans or keys, or package key status. You also cannot modify properties of the listing. Finally, you cannot remove subscribing members (Users) from the area as long as the contract is in effect.
