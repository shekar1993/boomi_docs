## About this task

Cross reference tables give end users flexibility in customizing cross reference translations used within their integration, either by extending or replacing the set of values provided by the integration developer.

## Procedure

1.  Open the process and click the **Extensions** link above the process canvas.

    The Extensions dialog opens.

2.  On the **Cross Reference** tab, turn on the check box next to each cross reference table that you would like to extend.

3.  When you are finished defining extensions, click **OK**.

4.  Click **Save**.

## Next steps

After defining cross reference table extensions, you need to set values for them. See the topic Setting Extension Values.
