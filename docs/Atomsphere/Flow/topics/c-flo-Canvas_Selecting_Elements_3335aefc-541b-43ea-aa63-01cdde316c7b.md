## Selecting a single map element

    -   Right-click and drag a canvas selection box around the relevant map element. Release to select the map element contained within the canvas selection box.

2.  Perform actions as required on the map element, such as moving it to a new position on the canvas, selecting another map element, deleting the map element and so on.

## Selecting multiple map elements 

To simultaneously select multiple map elements on the flow canvas:

1.  Either:
    -   Press **Ctrl** and left-click on multiple map elements to add them to your selection. A dotted line around each map element indicates that it is currently selected.
    -   Right-click and drag a canvas selection box around the relevant map elements. Release to select the map elements contained within the canvas selection box.
