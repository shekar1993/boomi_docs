    The Atom/Molecule/Cloud or Account Properties panel opens.

5.  If **Purge Data Immediately** is on, turn it off.

6.  Click **Save**.

## Results

Disabling purging for an Atom does not prevent purging for executions on that Atom of processes for which the purging option is selected in the Process Options dialog.
