This section describes the main steps for publishing APIs in the API Control Center dashboard. 

Publishing APIs in the API Control Center involves the following tasks:

1. Create an API definition. This details how Boomi Cloud API Management handles an API's request traffic (routing). 

2. Create a Package and Plan. This details the available access rights and the API's service level (for example, rate limits). 

3. Create your API documentation. This details how to add Interactive Documentation for API services via the I/O Docs page on the portal.

All these items are covered in the following [Publishing your APIs](../Getting_started_with_your_API/Publishing_steps/Publishing_your_APIs.md) section, which guides you through creating, sharing, accessing, and testing your API.
