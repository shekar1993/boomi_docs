To undeploy Local Edition and all the resources that are created at the time of deploying Local Edition, use Helm. 

Undeploying Local Edition has the following tasks:

1. Uninstalling an application. See [Uninstalling Local Edition Using Helm](../Installation/Uninstalling_loal_edition_using_helm.md).

2. Verifying all Kubernetes resources are deleted. See [Verifying Deleted K8s Resources](../Installation/Verifying_deleted_resources.md).

3. Removing user data.
