## Assigned API Products

In the first column you will see the display name and the image of the API product. In “Deployed On”, you can see in which environments this API product is deployed. The current API is therefore also deployed there. “Visibility” describes the general visibility, explained in [API Product Visibility](../Topics/cp-API_product_visibility.md), of the API product and “Published” whether it is visible in the Developer Portal.
