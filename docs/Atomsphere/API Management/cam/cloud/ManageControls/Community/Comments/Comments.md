Users express their opinions and share their experiences through comments of the published content on a Portal. By enabling moderation of comments in the Content page on the **Portal Settings** tab, you can review the comments before they are published and viewed by all users. For more information on setting up comment moderation, see [Content for Portal](../../Portal/Content_portal.md).
