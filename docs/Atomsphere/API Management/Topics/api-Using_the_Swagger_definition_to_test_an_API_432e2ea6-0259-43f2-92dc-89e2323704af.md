After receiving your API Key, you can view the REST tab to view the OpenAPI specification to test the API on the API details page.

## About this task

Once a subscription request has been approved, you will want to validate the associated APIs functionality and begin incorporating its use within your applications. To ensure proper execution of the API and necessary policies are employed, the API key would typically be included in the header as part of the actual API call invocation.

1.  From the Developer Portal, click **API Catalog**.
2.  View the available APIs or type your search filter in the **Search APIs by name** field to quickly navigate to your intended API.
3.  Click on the API card for the API that you have a valid API Key and API authentication information to view the Overview and REST documentation for that API.
4.  Click **REST** to view the OpenAPI reference.

    :::note 
    
    OpenAPI 3.0 reference is generated, and 2.0 Swagger is also available at he same URL as the OpenAPI reference, but the URL ends with `swagger.json` instead of `openapi.json`.
