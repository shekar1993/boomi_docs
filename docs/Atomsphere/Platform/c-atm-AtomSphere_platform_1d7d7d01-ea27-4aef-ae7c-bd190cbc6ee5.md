Boomi is a pioneer in the Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) space. Its cloud native [platform](https://platform.boomi.com/) lets you intelligently integrate applications, databases, devices; securely manage your data; design, secure, and scale APIs; extend connectivity, and build automated workflows.

With the drag and drop user interface and low-code platform, you can easily and quickly integrate any combination of cloud and on-premise applications, while increasing efficiency and reducing errors. Security is at the heart of everything we do, and Boomi has achieved U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)Authorization.

## What is iPaaS
The Integration Platform as a Service \([iPaaS](http://blogs.gartner.com/it-glossary/platform-as-a-service-paas/)\) is a suite of cloud services enabling development, deployment, and governance of integration flows connecting any combination of on-premise and cloud-based processes, services, applications, and data within individual or across multiple organizations.

## What makes the Boomi Enterprise Platform superior

The platform is a 100% cloud native, multi-tenant platform that supports a wide range of integration scenarios for application, data, and web services:

-   Cloud to cloud

-   SaaS to SaaS \(software-as-a-service\)

-   Cloud to on-premise

-   On-premise to on-premise

-   B2B integration


Here are some things that make us superior:

-   A **single-instance, multi-tenant architecture** enables sharing of underlying physical computing resources securely among multiple tenants or customer organizations.

-   The **Atom**, a [patented](http://www.google.com/patents/US20080270977), lightweight runtime engine allows integrations to be deployed wherever needed: in Boomi’s Atom Cloud, in a public or private cloud, or on-premises. The Atom transforms what was previously a rigid, complex, and costly approach to application integration into a fast, easy, and distributed integration of cloud-based and on-premise applications. Atoms are self-contained, autonomous, and run on virtually any server — deployed in the cloud for SaaS-to-SaaS integration or behind your firewall for SaaS-to-on-premise and on-premise-to-on-premise integrations.

-   **Configure integrations** using an intuitive visual designer, which simplifies the creation of application, data, and B2B integration processes through a library of common integration components that are available as pre-built connectors. Using point-and-click, drag-and-drop tools, you can build integrations quickly — from simple to sophisticated — with no coding.

-   **Supports scheduled and real-time integration**. It scales to meet the high-volume demands of mobile, extract, transform, load \(ETL\), and Electronic Data Interchange \(EDI\) environments.

-   **Automated data mapping** generates maps and functions for new integrations, simplifying one of the most challenging and error-prone aspects of building integrations.

-   **Automated connector configuration** lets you configure the connector query quickly and streamlines a time-consuming aspect of building integrations.

-   **Automated regression testing** delivers crowd-sourced regression testing to customers, providing the confidence that platform updates will not break existing integration processes.

-   Leverage the power of **crowd-sourcing to speed development**. We use crowd-sourced intelligence that collects anonymous platform usage data. Then, we make the information available to the Boomi community to reduce configuration, testing, and implementation times.

-   **Simplified error resolution** suggests answers for common errors based on contributions from our ecosystem of Boomi developers and architects.

-   **Access** the Boomi Enterprise Platform through a browser and get an impressive range of integration and platform extension capabilities.


## Boomi Enterprise Platform services 

The platform supports all popular [web browsers](c-boo-Browser_support_d10dc6bc-850c-4d4f-98ea-ce83b90c4abe.md#GUID-0B06D539-7C8F-4702-9C79-BAB886D4E710) and has localization support for Japanese and Spanish. Language options are offered depending on the preferred language settings in your web browser. If you want a particular default language, you must set that language as the main language in your browser settings.

Boomi recommends each person who accesses their platform account to have their own unique sign in. If multiple people share a user sign in, changes made by multiple people can override each other on the home screen.
