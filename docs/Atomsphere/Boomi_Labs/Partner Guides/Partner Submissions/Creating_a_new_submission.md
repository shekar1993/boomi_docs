The Submissions tool provides a step-by-step guide to help you submit your assets for review and approval by Boomi admins. You can create submissions for:

Start your submission process and follow the guided journey on the tool to fill out the following details for your asset.

The Submissions tool provides guided information to assist you throughout the process. For details on template guidelines, file size, and other specifications, refer directly to the tool

:::


1. **Recipe & Bundle Details**: Each recipe has an associated Bundle. Select the Bundle to attach to this Recipe and provide the required information.

2. **Assigned Tags**: You must assign tags to help categorize your recipes on Discover. They allow administrators to categorize recipes, making them easier for users to search and find. When submitting recipes, use appropriate tags to list them under relevant categories on Discover. 

3. **Recipe Demo**: The demo recording helps the Boomi team follow along visually and better understand the recipe before approving the submission.

4. **Key Features**:  Highlighting key features helps users understand the benefits of your recipe.

5. **Support**: Share support documents to provide additional details related to your recipe. 

6. **Community article**: Uploading or linking to a community article provides additional context for the Boomi team to understand your recipe better during approval.  

## Feedback process

The feedback mechanism facilitates communication between partners and Boomi admin, ensuring submissions meet Boomi standards.

Boomi admins can add detailed comments directly in the Submissions UI, activating the comment window for Partners in the Action Needed status to outline specific areas for review. Partners must review and address all comments to ensure the submission meets the guidelines.

## Email notifications

After submitting the recipe, you will receive an email notification about your submission status. Take necessary actions as needed. The system sends notifications in the following scenarios:

* **Submission reviewed and not approved**: Review the feedback on the submitted submission, incorporate necessary corrections, and then resubmit.    

* **Submission approved and published**: Boomi admin has approved and published your submission to Discover. 

## Next steps

After completing the review process and the assets meet Boomi's standards, the admins publish them to Boomi Discover, making them available for public use. This step increases the visibility of your assets and qualifies you to initiate Go-To-Market activities.
