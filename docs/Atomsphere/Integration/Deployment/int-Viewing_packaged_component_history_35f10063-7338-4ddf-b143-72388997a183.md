The Packaged Component History table displays a list of all the packaged versions that have been created for a given component.

## About this task

When you view a packaged component's history, you get detailed information about all the times a specific component was packaged. For example, I (the developer) packaged the process component Process1 three separate times because I kept making changes to the process configuration. Using the Packaged Component History page, I can see details about each of the three packaged versions of Process1 cataloged in one easy-to-access screen.

## Procedure

1. From the list on the Packaged Components page \(**Deploy** \> **Packaged Components**\), locate a packaged component in which you want to view its history.

2. In the same row as the packaged component, click the **Action** menu icon ![img-int-black_gear](../Images/main-ic-gear-black-16_cdde83e4-a176-436a-86ca-1fe4937e3085.jpg) and select **Packaged Component History** from the list of options.

    The Packaged Component History dialog appears and displays a list of all the packaged versions that were created for your selected component.

3. Use the **Add Filter**![img-atm-Add_filter](../Images/img-atm-Add_filter_e3ea3e31-68f5-46f4-b975-4f37e3d3df53.jpg) button to quickly filter table results by:

    - **Package Version** if you know the exact title of the version you are looking for.
    - **Sharing** to filter results according to whether or not versions are allowed to be shared to process libraries and integration packs.

4. Click **Apply** to add the filter. The packaged components that match the filter you selected appear in the list. The filter that is in affect is displayed at the top of the table. Click the **Clear** icon ![img-int-blue_circle_with_white_x](../Images/img-int-blue_circle_with_white_x_8a03d8b0-defd-4cfc-bcc1-b3d53392b78b.jpg) to clear any filters you have applied.

5. To display detailed information about a packaged component, click the **View Details** link in the **Action** column.

    The Packaged Component Details page is displayed.

    From the Packaged Components Details page, you can perform various actions such as viewing details about a specific version of the packaged component, viewing a list child components included with the primary component, determining if the packaged component was deployed and to which environment, and finally if the version was shared within the process library or an integration pack. To see more information, visit the Related Links section.

6. When you are finished, click **Close** to exit and return to the Packaged Components landing page.
