By installing updates to the Boomi Connector SDK Tools, you ensure that you have the latest tools to build your Eclipse projects.

## About this task

releases updates to the Connector SDK Tools plug-in for Eclipse as needed. You should periodically use Eclipse to check for updates and install them. These steps assume that you have installed the Connector SDK Tools.

## Procedure

1.  In Eclipse, select **Help** \> **Check for Updates**.

    The Available Updates wizard opens, and Eclipse checks for updates to the base Eclipse IDE and your installed plug-ins. For the Boomi Connector SDK Tools plug-in, Eclipse checks the plug-inâ€™s repository site at http://eclipse.boomi.com.

    If an update to the Boomi Connector SDK Tools is available, the plug-in name appears in the Available Updates list and is selected. The remaining steps assume this is the case.
