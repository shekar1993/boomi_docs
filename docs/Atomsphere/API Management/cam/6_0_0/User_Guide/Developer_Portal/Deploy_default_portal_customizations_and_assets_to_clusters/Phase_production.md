When the customizations are completed and you are preparing to deploy a new version of the Developer Portal, you must configure the tml-installer build job. Upload the interface-compliant ZIP file. When you deploy the production clusters, the contents of the interface-compliant ZIP file are extracted into each tml-cm container that you managed during installation. All of your customizations are immediately available.
