Add, edit, view, and remove users from an account group.

The Users in Group list on the right side of the Access Control tab displays all users in the selected account group.

- **Add** - Used to add a new user or add an existing user to the account group.

- **Edit** - Used to change a user's default role in the selected account group. A user can be assigned different roles in different account groups. If the user is in other account groups, changing his role in this account group does not affect his role in other account groups.

- **Remove** - Used to remove a user from the selected account group.

- **View** - Used to view all of the account groups to which the selected user is assigned. When a user is selected, his current role and privileges within the account group are displayed to the right of the user's email address.
