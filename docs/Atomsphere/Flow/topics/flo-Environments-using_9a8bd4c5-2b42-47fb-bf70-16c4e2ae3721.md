Build and add flows to a release.

## Adding flows to a release

To add flows to an existing release:

1.  Open the flow canvas for the flow that you would like to add to a release.
2.  Click the **Build** icon in the canvas options menu to open the **Build Flow** form.
3.  Select the release from the **Add to release** field drop-down menu.
4.  Click **Build Flow** to build the flow and add it to the release.

    -   You can continue to build flows and add them to the release.

    -   You can promote the release to the next environment. See [Promoting a release](flo-Environments-promoting-releases_85e7790e-d62e-4778-a54f-b8ed1c7bc7bb.md).


:::note

If you build and add a flow to a release that has already been deployed to the test environment, the release is reset and automatically deployed back into the development environment.
