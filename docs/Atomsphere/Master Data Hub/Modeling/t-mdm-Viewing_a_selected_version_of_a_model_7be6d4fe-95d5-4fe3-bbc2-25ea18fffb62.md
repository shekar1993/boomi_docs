You can view any version of a model, current or previous, as a means of seeing when and how the model changed or determining which version to deploy.

## Procedure

1.  Do one of the following:

    -   Navigate to a page for any repository to which the model is deployed, and in the domains summary list, click the domain modelâ€™s version number.

        ![This example of the Repositories page shows the deployed version of the model Account is 7.0, Contact 5.0, and Employee 2.0.](../Images/Repositories/mdm-ps-repository-summary-tab_d566c0ca-d9c9-4c86-b275-3b3ae2858141.jpg)

    -   In the **Models** page, in the gear icon ![](../Images/main-ic-gear-gray_54d864eb-b5de-4ee6-9b31-975dae0a5762.jpg) menu for the model, select **View Publication History**.

    -   In the **Models** page, click the number of the most recently published version.

    In each case, the Model Publication History view opens.

    ![This example of the Model Publication History view shows the publication date and notes for each of the five versions of the model Contact.](../Images/Models/mdm-ps-model-history_e074bef7-f3b3-4edf-90cb-8694c035b161.jpg)

2.  In the versions summary list entry for the version you want to view, click **![icon](../Images/Models/main-ic-arrow-popping-from-square_6b63e5cc-2b87-419a-bebf-383676aa724e.jpg) View this version of the model**.

    The model page opens, read-only, in a separate browser tab or window.
