## Creating a new page

As well as managing existing pages on this page, you can also create a new page:

1.  Click the **New Page** button. See [Creating a page](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/t-flo-Pages_Creating_Page_Layout_8547b517-a2e6-4d0e-8ae3-736597064154.md).

## Searching/filtering pages

The **Search** field allows you to search for and filter which pages are shown in the table.

This is useful if you have a large number of pages, or wish to quickly search for a specific page.

1.  Enter the text into the **Search** field that you wish to filter the table by. Partial search terms can be used, for example, entering "Doc" will filter the table so that all/only pages containing 'Doc' in their name are shown.
2.  Click the **Search** icon to perform the search.
