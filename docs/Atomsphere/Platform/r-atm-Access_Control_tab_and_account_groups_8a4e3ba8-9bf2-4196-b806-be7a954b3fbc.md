The All Accounts account group displays a table of accounts that the currently-selected primary account can assign to an account group.

By default, the All Accounts account group is displayed. If the currently selected account is not a primary account, then no accounts appear in the table. The primary account is not a member of the account groups to which it assigns accounts.

In this example the "Documentation" account is the currently selected primary account. When you view the All Accounts account group, you can see four accounts that the Documentation primary account can assign to account groups.
