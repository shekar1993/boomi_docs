Use the **Settings** \> **User Information** \> **AtomSphere API Tokens** page to generate API tokens on your user account.

:::note

To view the AtomSphere API Tokens page, you must have the API Access privilege.

:::

Use the following steps to add up to 5 unique API tokens on your user account. Once the token is generated, you will no longer have the ability to view or copy the full token value for security reasons. Therefore, it is important to safely and securely store your token for later use.

1. Select **Settings** \> **User Information** and click the **AtomSphere API Tokens** tab.

   If you have one or more API tokens created on your user account, you will see each token listed with their name, date created, and status details.

2. Click **Add New Token**.

   The New API Token dialog opens and prompts you to enter a name for the new token.

3. Enter a name for the new token, and click **Generate Token**. Each token must have a unique name as they are used for identification purposes when making API calls. Token names are limited to 100 characters.

   The New API Token screen opens and prompts you to copy your newly generated API token.

4. To copy the new token to your clipboard, do one of the following:

   - Click the Copy to Clipboard icon ![img-int-flow_copy_boxes](./Images/main-ic-copy_boxes_399199e2-8510-4b88-8a36-ea14e1062ac3.jpg) to copy the token string without exiting. A message displays stating that the value has been copied to your clipboard. When you are ready to close the dialog, click the **Copy to Clipboard & Close** button.
   - Click the **Copy to Clipboard & Close** button to copy the token string and exit the dialog.

5. Store your new API token in a secure location. Boomi recommends that you treat your tokens with the same level of security as you would a password.

## Results

Your new token is now generated, and you can view its details on the AtomSphere API Tokens page.

:::note

To use the AtomSphere API and AtomSphere Partner API, Boomi encourages users to replace instances of their username and password credentials with their API tokens where applicable.
