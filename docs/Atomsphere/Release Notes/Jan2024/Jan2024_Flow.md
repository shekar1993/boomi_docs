- **Anomaly Detection**: This feature allows you to stay one step ahead by pinpointing faults, saving time, and enhancing security.
  - Anomaly Detection analyzes your flows and reports anomalies when unexpected actions or behaviors occur.
  - This can assist you in identifying and diagnosing faults in your flow that are not easily identifiable.Â (FLOW-2783)
