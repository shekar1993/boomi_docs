:::caution Restriction

Antivirus programs that scan the installation folder of your Atoms, Molecules, or Atom Clouds might conflict with their operation. For example, if the antivirus program attempts to access the files while your Atoms, Molecules, or Atom Clouds are running, it can cause conflicts. Also, the antivirus program could cause permission issues by being seen as a different user. Therefore, disable the antivirus program from running against the Atom, Molecule, or Atom Cloud installation folders during planned maintenance windows. Additionally, after running the antivirus program, check the quarantine folder for any valid files quarantined incorrectly.
