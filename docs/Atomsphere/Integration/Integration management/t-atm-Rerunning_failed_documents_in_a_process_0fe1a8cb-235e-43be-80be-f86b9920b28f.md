You can rerun failed documents in a process from Process Reporting.

## Procedure

1.  On the **Manage** menu, select **Process Reporting**.

    By default, all process executions that occurred in the account within the past hour are displayed.

2.  Change the search options and filters to locate the process execution that you need.

3.  In the process execution results table, find the process that failed and click its link in the **Time** column.

    The process execution detail view opens. It includes a Documents with Errors table.

4.  Click the error description in the Error Message column.

    The Document Error detail view appears.

5.  In the **![Gear or Actions icon](../Images/main-ic-gear-gray_54d864eb-b5de-4ee6-9b31-975dae0a5762.jpg) Actions** menu, select ![Re-run Document](../Images/main-ic-document-two-blue-curved-arrows_d5a9b591-588d-4888-94aa-3839cdb10912.jpg) **Re-run Document** or ![Run Document in Test Mode](../Images/main-ic-document-with-gear_bb87e431-ee33-4e21-a010-c8989ff93c28.jpg) **Run Document in Test Mode**.

6.  Click **OK**.
