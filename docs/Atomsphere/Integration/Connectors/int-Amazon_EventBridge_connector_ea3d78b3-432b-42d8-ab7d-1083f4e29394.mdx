The Amazon EventBridge connector allows you to transfer any number of events \(data\) in JSON format to any Amazon services by connecting through Amazon EventBridge.

Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that sends events real-time from a number of partner event sources and over ninety-five different event services, and can target AWS services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS, and Amazon SNS.


:::note

- This is an open source connector and you can access the code in the [Amazon EventBridge](https://bitbucket.org/officialboomi/amazon-eventbridge) connector repository.

- This connector only supports **Event**.

:::

## Connector configuration

To configure the connector to communicate with Amazon EventBridge, set up two components:

-   Amazon EventBridge connection
-   Amazon EventBridge operation

This approach creates reusable components which contain connection settings and operation settings. After building your connection and operation, set up your Amazon EventBridge connector within a process. When the process is defined properly, Integration can map to virtually any system using the Amazon EventBridge connector to send events to event buses on AWS.

## Prerequisites

To implement a connection to your Amazon EventBridge account from Integration, make sure you have the following:

-   An Atom deployed on your local machine, or hosted with Boomi Integration.

-   Your AWS access key and AWS secret key.

-   Amazon EventBridge access for your account if using an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) account \(recommended\).

-   Event buses and rules set up on your Amazon EventBridge service \(minimal implementation requires the default event bus and one rule specified with a target service\).



:::note

When using a Windows environment and a local Atom, add the following line in the `atom.vmoptions` file inside the Atom/bin folder so the Greek letters are processed successfully: `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8`

:::

You must add this line because by default, Windows uses Windows-1252 character encoding where Greek letters are not encoded properly. UTF-8 encoding \(default in Linux\) is required to successfully encode the characters.
