## Licensing and Usage


Event Streams is licensed based on annual message volume. The amount of messages you are entitled to will vary depending upon which Tier you purchase.



## Messages


- Messages are defined as an event that is published to an Event Streams topic or consumed by a destination client.
- Messages are comparable to a “Document” in Boomi Integration.
- Individual messages can be up to 1MB in size

## Annual Message Volume



- Annual message volume is defined as the number of messages published \(In Messages\) + number messages consumed \(Out Messages\) per contract year.
- Annual message volume includes usage across all of your environments

:::note  

If your usage exceeds your annual quota, Event Streams will continue to work. Boomi will contact your account administrator to discuss moving to a higher tier.
