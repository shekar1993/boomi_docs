Set up your account for the [Partner Portal](https://platform.boomi.com/partner-portal/) and log in using the link provided by Boomi upon your acceptance into the Technology Partner Program. 

First-time users need to complete the Company Profile Setup as your initial task. You can manage your Company Profile and invite teammates directly from the **Settings** page. Logging in with an incomplete Company profile prompts you to update it. Completing all required fields will direct you to the Partner Portal Dashboard upon your next login.

## Key features

The Dashboard serves as your personalized hub, providing quick access to essential information and resources tailored to your partnership with Boomi. It facilitates the seamless initiation of projects, allowing you to create new use casesâ€”building connectors or recipes, exploring market opportunities with Boomi, learning about the Technology Partner Program (TPP), or other relevant scenarios of your choice.

The UI displays recent projects in a user-friendly card layout, enabling efficient project management and progress monitoring. 

The portal also features management of initiated projects, ensuring that all aspects remain organized and accessible. The card layout provides clear visibility into these projects' status and completion levels, making it easy to track progress and manage tasks effectively.

You can readily access relevant training courses to enhance your skills and maximize the value of your partnership with Boomi.

Furthermore, the platform ensures quick access to essential resources and tools that support your journey. By utilizing resources like the Interactive Boomi Integration demo, you can gain hands-on experience with the platform. Additionally, Boomi Discover helps you explore various integration solutions, best practices, and community-driven insights, allowing you to deepen your understanding of the platform and its capabilities.
