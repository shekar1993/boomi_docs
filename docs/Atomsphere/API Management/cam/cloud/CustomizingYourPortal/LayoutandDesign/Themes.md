We've built three starter themes to help you get up-and-running more quickly.

[Download the Starter Kit](https://github.com/mashery/portal-theme-starter-kit/archive/master.zip) and unzip it. The files for all three themes are in the dist folder. Pick the theme you like best.

**Prefer to bring your own favorite CSS boilerplate or framework instead?** That's totally cool! Use [Blackbeard's template system](Templates.md) to customize the markup as needed.

## What's included

Each theme includes a unique style and layout. They all include a collection of frequently requested features:

- Expand-and-collapse navigation menus on smaller screens.

- Optional [Stripe-like documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api).

- Accordion/show-and-hide content areas.

- Display the latest blog posts anywhere on your Portal.

- Responsive videos for great documentation on any device.

- Animated scrolling to anchor links.

- Multi-language support.
