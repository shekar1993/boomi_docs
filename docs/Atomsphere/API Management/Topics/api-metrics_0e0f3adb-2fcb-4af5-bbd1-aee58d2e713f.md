API Management Metrics services collect the metadata of API calls through the API Gateway or the Web Services Server and allows you to retrieve the data using a GraphQL client. Metrics services return information such as the count of calls per API, successful API requests, popular authentication types for APIs, and the quota status of a subscribed API.

Boomi retains metrics data for 540 days. If you require usage for a longer period of time, back up data as necessary.


If you have multi-node Gateways, Molecules, or Clouds, you can add the following to enable the [Working Data Local Storage Directory](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Integration%20management/t-atm-Enabling_local_storage_for_a_Molecule_or_Atom_Cloud_8861cfb6-79fa-46bc-a957-a4a3cfa45d5f.md): `com.boomi.container.localDir`

:::note 

If the working data local storage directory is not configured, events are reported in `<base_dir>/<localhost_id>/events`.

:::

:::note

Ensure that there is sufficient disk space available. Metrics requires approximately 1 KB per request, per day. Files roll over each day and removed when not needed.

## Endpoint

``` 
https://api.boomi.com/graphql
```

## Metrics Data Locations 
Metrics data locations:
-   For Atoms, the metrics data is written to the `<installation>/events` directory.
-   For Gateways, Molecules, and Clouds, the metrics data is written to the `<local dir>/events` directory.

  :::note
  You may need to verify that your network security settings are not blocking metrics reporting. Atoms and Gateways hit the following endpoints for metrics reporting:
    - `wss://atom.boomi.com/service/runtime-events/receiver`
    - `https://atom.boomi.com/service/runtime-events/receiver/1/process`
  :::

## Configure Metrics Data
All of the following properties can be configured on the Gateway or the Atom [container property](/docs/Atomsphere/API%20Management/Topics/api-Container_properties_7db1ee5a-03b9-4d07-931b-4e863e7cc6de.md).

### Maximum File Size

You can configure the maximum file size for metrics events files. The default is 1 GB (1073741824 bytes) by default for Gateways and 4MB (4194304 bytes) for Atoms. The value of this property must be defined in bytes.

-   For Gateways, configure the `com.boomi.container.apigateway.metrics.maxFileSize` container property.

-   For Atoms, configure the `com.boomi.container.sharedServer.http.metrics.maxFileSize` container property.

### Event Rollover Time
You can configure the event rollover time for Gateways and Atoms. By default, this is set at six hours but can be changed to 24 hours or less.

-   For Gateways, configure the `com.boomi.container.apigateway.metrics.maxFileAge` container property.
-   For Atoms, configure the `com.boomi.container.sharedServer.http.metrics.maxFileAge` container property.

### 404 Errors
You can configure if 404 errors are captured for metrics data. By default, this is set to false.

-   For Gateways, set the `com.boomi.container.apigateway.metrics.reportNotFound` container property to true.
-   For Atoms, set the `com.boomi.container.sharedServer.http.metrics.reportNotFound` container property to true.

### Event File Flushing
You can configure when an event file is flushed to disk. This is useful for low-traffic Atoms or Gateways that are running on Windows. The default is 0, which means that flushing will be delegated to the OS. For example, if you set this property to 10, it would take a maximum of 10 events before the events are flushed to the disk and can then be reported and viewed in the metrics dashboard.
- For Gateways, configure the `com.boomi.container.apigateway.metrics.flushAfterEvents` container property.
- For Atoms, configure the `com.boomi.container.sharedServer.http.metrics.flushAfterEvents` container property.

## Query Syntax 

-   `deployedApiCallDetail`: This query returns API request details that match the filters in the input object. 1000 results are returned by default and this is not configurable. If additional records exist, it populates the `nextRequestTs` and `nextTransactionID` fields in the return object.

    ``` 
    deployedApiCallDetail(input: DeployedApiCallDetailInput!): DeployedApiCallDetail!
    ```

-   `deployedApiCallSummary`: Returns grouped and aggregated API request info as specified by the request fields and applies the filters specified in the input object. You can optionally provide a field named `TimeInterval` for grouping data. `TimeInterval` should be given in a way such that the records can be grouped into 1000 or less groups.

    ``` 
    deployedApiCallSummary(input: DeployedApiCallSummaryInput!): DeployedApiCallSummary!
    ```

## Using the filter attribute 

You cannot filter the following fields from the platform:

-   Gateway
-   Atom
-   deployedApi

To filter by API Key, use:

``` 
filter: "client.subscription.apiKeyId = 'f1xxxx77-fxxc-4e19-b144-6efxxxxxxxf6e' "
```
To filter using the `like` operator, use:

``` 
filter: "requestUrl like '%8077/wS%'"
```
:::note
The `like` operator does not work for date and can filter for `string` values only. Use >, < , and = to search.

## Altair script 

Programmatic access to GraphQL APIs is available with any application, typically through a GraphQL client library in the language of choice. You can use Altair, a user interface tool, to accomplish this. You can use the following script as an option to access GraphQL APIs quickly. See [Altair Script](/docs/Atomsphere/API%20Management/Topics/api-GraphQL_API_Management_APIs_18f1a55a-b3d7-4b9e-ab0a-162fc4a67686.md).
