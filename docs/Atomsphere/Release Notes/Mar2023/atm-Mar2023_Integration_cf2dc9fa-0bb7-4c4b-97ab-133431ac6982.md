## Process Building

Features:

-   We enhanced the steps palette. You can now see more steps, Recents and featured connectors, in addition to a larger search result of connectors from our growing catalog. \(INT-7456\)

    To learn more about this feature, see topics: [ Working in the Component Explorer](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Process%20building/c-atm-Component_Explorer_b293eeb3-9616-4aa0-ba2d-60cf2d1f37fd.md), [ Process canvas](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Process%20building/c-atm-Process_canvas_7092acce-da3a-4bf1-9130-ac2b74eebd22.md), and [ Process building](/docs/Atomsphere/Integration/Process%20building/c-atm-Process_building_b422a00a-b17b-4ea8-ae01-d04adaf97e16.md)

-   Based on your feedback, we have redesigned the process step icons to improve recognition and differentiation. You can enable the new icons for your user prior to their roll-out later this year. \( INT-6231\)

    To learn more about this feature, see topics: [User Preferences](/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/atm-Preferences_8755af68-ec6f-4f6d-8c03-416e654cf479.md), and [ Integration step and Component Icon Refresh](https://community.boomi.com/s/article/Integration-Shape-and-Component-Icon-Refresh)


Fixes:

-   We resolved the issue where inadvertent clicks on the process canvas when configuring a newly added step would remove the step from the canvas without warning. \(INT-4527\)

-   We resolved an issue where changes to component names were not immediately reflected in choosers within the Data Process step. \(INT-5958\)
