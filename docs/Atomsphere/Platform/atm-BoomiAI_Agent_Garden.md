### What are AI agents?

AI agents are software components that have a defined purpose and personality. They provide automation and perform specific tasks with or without human intervention. They use AI-based reasoning to independently decide how to accomplish a task and take action. Some AI agents can work together to complete complex processes seamlessly.

For example, a travel booking agent could receive a user’s request and independently orchestrate other AI agents to book the requested travel experience. Different AI agents work together to obtain information and then take action by reserving a hotel, car rentals, and flights.

Several AI agents are currently available on the platform. We encourage you to revisit the documentation regularly as Boomi AI continues to evolve with exciting new agents and improvements.

## User-created AI Agents

User-created AI agents are developed using the Boomi Enterprise Platform, which provides all the necessary building blocks.

- Boomi’s connectivity and orchestration capabilities enable users to interact with selected models via API, access proprietary data sources, and automate actions through various applications. 
- The Boomi platform’s process canvas allows the creation of sophisticated workflows to retrieve, combine, filter, and contextualize data, facilitating model prompting and techniques like RAG and fine-tuning. 
- DataHub serves as an access point and repository for the agents’ knowledge base.
- Flow and API Management offer human or machine interfaces to package these components into standalone AI agents.
