Microsoft Teams connector allows you to connect to your Microsoft Teams server and perform required data transfer from/to, using Microsoft Graph REST APIs.

The Microsoft Teams operation defines how to interact with your Microsoft Teams server and represent a specific action \(Create, Get, Execute, Manage, List, Delete\) to be performed against one/many Microsoft Teams resources. Create a separate operation component for each action combination that your integration requires.

The Microsoft Teams connector supports the following actions:

-   Inbound: Get, List
-   Outbound: Create, Execute, Manage, Delete

## Options tab

Click **Import Operation**, then use the Import wizard to select the object to integrate. In the **Import Wizard**, provide the specific Microsoft Team resources \(E.g. Channel, Team, Team Member, Chat Message\). When you configure an action, the following fields appear on the connector **Options** tab.

**Connector Action \(All Operations\)**: Determines the type of operation the connector is performing related to Inbound or Outbound. Depending on how you create the operation component, the action type is either configurable or non-configurable from the drop-down list.

**Object \(All Operations\)**: Defines a specific Microsoft Teams resource \(Channel, Group, Team\) you want to integrate, which you selected in the **Import Wizard**.

**Request Profile \(Create\)**: The JSON profile representing the structure to process a specific request on the selected Microsoft Teams resource. Import the Request Profile by choosing the Microsoft Teams resource from the Object Type drop down.

<TrackingDir />

<ReturnErrRes />

**Enable Bulk Provisioning \(Create\)**: Select the check box to perform bulk creation of channel/group/team members/team on the Microsoft Teams server. The accepted input file format is CSV Format.

**Team ID \(Create\)**: Specify the Team ID in which the channel must be created. Mandatory for new channel creation.

    
:::note

To get the Team ID from your Microsoft Teams application, navigate to your Team title, click on the icon next to your Team title. Click on **Get link to team**. The groupId in the URL represents the Team ID.

:::

Team ID example: `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a2b41847106b946e4adf6975f34d63ebd%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=9b885541-08f9-4f10-b8df-282323d25a40&tenantId=e0793d39-0939-496d-b129-198edd916feb`

**Group ID \(Create\)**   
Specify the group ID to which new team member must be attached to. Mandatory for team creation.

**Message ID \(Execute\)**   
Specify ID of the message to which the user intends to reply. Mandatory only for Execute operation – Replying to a Message in a Channel.

    
:::note

Always leave this field as empty during Execute operation other than replying to a message. Else, API response will throw BAD REQUEST. To get the Message ID from your Microsoft Teams application, navigate to your Team title. Click on the icon next to your Team title, then click on **Get link to team**. The parentMessageId in the URL represents the Message ID.

:::

Message ID example: `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:0e4270b8a1224820adbe383dbe76692c@thread.tacv2/1591488878610?tenantId=ac7b98d5-19cc-47bc-97fd-a56cb8690903&groupId=953aa6bd-5d6d-4182-a591-2a6b14ee74ca&parentMessageId=1591488878610&teamName=Test%20Team%20Sprint%201&channelName=General&createdTime=1591488878610`

## Create

Create is an outbound action that you can use to create a new Microsoft resource like Channel, Team Members, Group, Team in your Microsoft Teams server. This operation can be performed either as a single or bulk processing. Use the **Import Wizard** to select the required Teams object, request and response profile. The JSON request profile contains the properties for a single object.

-   Single - You can use the Message step to provide the input request.
-   Bulk creation – You must select the Enable Bulk Provisioning check box on the CREATE operation – Options tab and pass the input in CSV format. You can use the Disk step connector for loading the input CSV file and then Map step for associating the CSV fields with the request JSON profile.

If the operation is successful, the connector returns a response in JSON format with the created Microsoft Teams object details. The connector supports the following Create actions explained below.


:::note

For all operations, make sure the process input file size does not exceed more than 1MB.

:::

#### Create Channel

Use this operation to create new channels in a Microsoft Teams server based on user’s input request. For a channel creation, you must specify the following details:

-   In the **Import Wizard**, the Object Type must be selected as **“Create Channel”**.
-   On the Create operation – **Options** tab, provide a valid ID of the team in which channel needs to be created.

    
    :::note

    The TEAM ID can also be defined as a document property using the Set Properties step. In such case, the value defined in the Set Properties step will override the value defined on the Operation - **Options** tab.

    :::

    Make sure the registered client app has below API permissions configured in the Microsoft Azure Portal.

    -   API Name: Group.ReadWrite.All
    -   Permission Type: Application

Post the successful import, the Object, Request Profile and Response Profile get updated on the **Options** tab. Sample Input JSON:

```json
{ "displayName": "Architecture Discussion", "description": "To discuss on all future architecture plans" }
```

The connector provides JSON response with success code and channel object.

#### Bulk Creation of Channels

To perform bulk creation of channels, you must:

-   Select the **Enable Bulk Provisioning** check box on the Create operation – **Options** tab.
-   Provide the process input in a CSV format. CSV structure includes:
    1.  Header section – First row of the CSV. Individual cells in the header denote the request JSON fields required in a single create operation. The columns can be placed in any position, but the names must match with the request JSON fields as per the Create Channel API.
    2.  Request section – Actual input data records. Can include as many rows as required. During the Import, select the **Object Type** as **“Bulk Provisioning Of Channels”**. Rest of the connector operation properties remain same as the single channel creation.

Sample Input Request \(CSV\):

```
"id", "method", "url", "description", "displayName", "Content-Type" "1", "POST", "/teams/9845ec1b-f50b-44ad-967b-1e5a988c38f9/channels", "BulkChannelAug_01", "BulkChannelAug01", "application/json" "2", "POST", "/teams/9845ec1b-f50b-44ad-967b-1e5a988c38f9/channels", "BulkChannelAug_02", "BulkChannelAug02", "application/json"

New team member/user\(s\) can be created based on the input details or from a master list of the user’s company. In the **Import Wizard**, select the **Object Type** as “Create Member”. To associate a team member to a specific group, provide the Group ID value in the Create operation – **Options** tab. The Group ID can also be defined as a document property using the Set Properties step. In such case, the value defined in the Set Properties step will override the value defined on the Options tab. Make sure the registered client app has below API permissions.

-   API Name: User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All
-   Permission Type: Application

To add the members/users to a group, make sure the Usage Location and Exchange Online Plan license assignment are configured to the user in the Azure Active Directory Services - Microsoft Azure Portal. Sample Input JSON:

```
{ "accountEnabled": true, "displayName": "displayName-value", "mailNickname": "mailNickname-value", "userPrincipalName": "upn-value@tenant-value.onmicrosoft.com", "passwordProfile": { "forceChangePasswordNextSignIn": true, "password": "password-value" } }
```

#### Bulk Creation of Team Members

To perform bulk creation of team members, you must:
