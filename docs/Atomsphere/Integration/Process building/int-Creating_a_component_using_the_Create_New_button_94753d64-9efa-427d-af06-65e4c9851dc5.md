Use the **Create New** button on the Build page to create a new process component or other component.

## About this task

You can complete this task only if you have Build Write Access. If you have Build Read Access only, you cannot create new Integration processes. For example, the **Create New** button does not appear. Also, on the Build Process screen, the ability to create components is unavailable. However, you can still view and click items recently opened on the **Start** tab.

## Procedure

1.  On the Build page, click **Create New**.

2.  Select a component type from the list, like **Process** or **Connection**.

    Components appear in alphabetical order; hovering on a component type shows a short description to help you understand your choices. You can also use the search field to filter for a specific component type.

3.  The component opens.

    Some component types \(Connector, Operation, Trading Partner, Communication Channels, and EDI Profiles\) require additional information before you can start configuring it for your process.

    This extra information designates things like an application or profile type, communication method, or technical standards.

4.  If you did not make configuration changes, save your new component by clicking **Save** or **Save and Close**.

    :::note

    Closing the component tab without saving changes at any point after its initial creation deletes it.

5.  **Optional**: New components in Component Explorer save and go into the correct group according to their type. You can change the component's folder location by dragging and dropping it to a new place in Component Explorer or clicking the [Folder](int-Component_Folder_Details_6a08d25e-f8ff-4f63-9af4-4a4e8a443158.md) link on the opened component.
