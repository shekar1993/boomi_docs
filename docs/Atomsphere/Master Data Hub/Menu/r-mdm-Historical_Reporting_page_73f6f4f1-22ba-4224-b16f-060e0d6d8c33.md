## ![icon](../Images/Reporting/main-bt-arrow-blue-down-to-computer_a12a7650-c6de-4ec5-9d1f-50163cc0f349.jpg) Download CSV 

Exports report data to comma-separated values \(CSV\) format.

Depending on the browser and its download settings, it may be necessary to specify the destination path and filename to complete the request.

The default CSV filename is mdm-report-timestamp.csv, where timestamp is the date and time of the download request in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.

In the CSV file:

-   The first column always represents the date of a data point in the displayed report. This representation is consistent with the tabular report format option.

-   Breakdowns are represented as follows: Header rows â€” for example, Date, Account, Repository, etc. â€” are in row \#2, and breakdown information â€” for example, Golden Record, Quarantine Entry â€” are in row \#1.


## Reported data types 

Data types selected for reporting, and, if applicable, data selected for inclusion in data point breakdown, are listed below the **Add Report Data** button. The list is a color-coded legend to data points and breakdown in a report for which a chart format is selected. Clicking **![](../Images/Common/main-ic-x-white-in-gray-circle-16_0abafeee-d5e7-4888-9bfb-475b11b6d00f.jpg)** on a data typeâ€™s list entry removes the data type from the report.

If a single data type is selected and **Breakdown by â€¦** is off, the Mean, Min\(imum\)/Max\(imum\) counts, and Median are shown. The total count is shown as well if the selected data type is **Quarantine Entries Created** \(total or by Cause\), **Inbound Data**, or **Completed Transactions** \(total or by Result\).



**Breakdown by account/repository/model/source**
<br />If on \(switched to the right\), data point breakdown is visible in the report.

-   Data points in an account group-level report are broken down by account.

-   Data points in an account-level report are broken down by repository.

-   Data points in a repository-level report are broken down by model \(domain\).

-   Data points in a model-level report are broken down by source.


Check boxes toggle data visibility in the breakdown. Data is visible in the breakdown only if the check box for the data is on.

This switch is in the off position and is disabled while the selected scope is limited to a single source, multiple data types are selected, or **Golden Record Count** is selected and the scope is limited to a single model.

## Report Options 

These controls are used to select the report format:


- **Most Recent** - These controls are used to select the reporting interval and period. The current selection is highlighted in orange.
- **7d** - Refreshes the displayed report to show data for each day during the seven-day period ending yesterday.
- **1m** - Refreshes the displayed report to show data for each day during the one-month period ending yesterday â€” for example, June 11-July 10.
- **6m** - Refreshes the displayed report to show data for each week \(Monday-Sunday\) during the six-month period ending last Sunday.
- **1y** - Refreshes the displayed report to show data for each calendar month during the one-year period ending yesterday.
- **Custom** - While selected, these controls for specifying a custom reporting period are revealed. 

**Start Date**
<br />The start date for the period can be typed or selected using the calendar control.

**End Date**
<br />The end date for the period can be typed or selected using the calendar control.

Changing **Start Date** or **End Date** refreshes the displayed report to reflect the newly specified period. The reporting interval automatically adjusts to accommodate the length of the specified period.

<br />Changes the report format to a stacked bar chart. This format is meaningful only for multiple data type reporting, where relationships exist between data types, and for data point breakdown.

**![icon](../Images/Reporting/main-bt-view-table_72d4bb95-26f8-4af0-b3e8-289cc3e4138f.jpg)View Tabular Data**
<br />Changes the report format to a table. The table is sorted in reverse chronological order.

## Report

In a report for which a chart format is selected:

-   Pausing the pointer on an ordinary data point shows the associated data type, the date or date range and the count.

-   Pausing the pointer on a data item in a breakdown shows the associated model \(domain\) or source, the date or date range, and the count.

-   If the report is restricted to a single data type and **Breakdown by â€¦** is off, dashed horizontal lines represent the mean and median. Pausing the pointer on either of these lines shows the represented metric. If the date range of the report spans multiple years, the start of a year is indicated by an appropriately labeled vertical line.
