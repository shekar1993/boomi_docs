You can view a deployed version of a process in Process Reporting.

## Procedure

1.  In the **Manage** menu's **Process Reporting** page, find the desired process execution result.

2.  Do one of the following:

    -   In the **![Gear or Actions icon](../Images/main-ic-gear-blue-and-arrow-black-16_188e61d7-2204-48ad-b085-15fa4a70615d.jpg) Actions** menu for that execution, select **![Multiple Gears](../Images/step-ic-process-call-32_0a02413b-c876-48a2-9ff1-dddea14e200f.jpg) View Process**.

    -   Click the date/time link for that execution to go to its detail view and in the **![Grayed out gear](../Images/main-ic-gear-gray_54d864eb-b5de-4ee6-9b31-975dae0a5762.jpg) Actions** menu, select **![Multiple Gears](../Images/step-ic-process-call-32_0a02413b-c876-48a2-9ff1-dddea14e200f.jpg) View Process**.

    -   If this process execution result is a retried execution, this icon ![Retried execution](../Images/main-ic-snowman-green-arrow-16_bec211cb-e8b9-4646-bb28-453cff4a8b39.jpg) appears to the right of the date/time link. If you want to view the original execution, click the icon. Then follow one of the steps above to view the original process execution.

    The deployed version of the process opens in a new browser tab or window.
