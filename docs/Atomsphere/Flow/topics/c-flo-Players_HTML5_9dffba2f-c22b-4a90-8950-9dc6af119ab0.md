If the default legacy player does not provide the features or styling that you require, you can create and customize your own player.

## Overview

Once you have created a custom legacy player, you can customize it completely. For example, you can create and link to a stylesheet in the player, allowing you to apply your own custom CSS and change the entire appearance of your flows when viewed in a browser.
