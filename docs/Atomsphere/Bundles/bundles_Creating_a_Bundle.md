Bundle development enables you to combine one or more Boomi services and Custom assets to share with any number of accounts. As a Bundle developer, you should consider Bundles as solution templates that help users get started with a particular use case. <br/><br/>
To create a new Bundle, perform the following steps:<br/>

1. On the [Bundles](https://platform.boomi.com/BoomiLabs.html#pub_bundles;) page, click **Create a New Bundle** and enter the following details:

    * **Bundle Name** - Type a name for your Bundle.

    * **Bundle Details** (optional) - Type a short description for your Bundle.

2. Click **Create.**
  
    Bundle is created.

:::note

 When you create a Bundle, the bundle visibility is set to `Private` by default. For more information on Bundle visibility check [here](./bundles_Editing_a_Bundle.md).

:::

After creating the Bundle you can perform the following actions:

* [Work with Bundle Assets](./bundles_Working_with_Bundle_Assets.md)
* [Edit a Bundle](./bundles_Editing_a_Bundle.md)
* [Share a Bundle](./bundles_Sharing_a_Bundle.md)
* [Delete a Bundle](./bundles_Deleting_a_Bundle.md)
* [Install a Bundle](./bundles_Installing_a_Bundle.md)

If you are in the Bundle Ownerâ€™s account, you can edit a Bundle to change details and add or delete assets. For Bundles that you do not have access to the Owner account, you can only view the details and install.
