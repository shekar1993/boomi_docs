The Web Services SOAP Client operation performs a specific request action, defined in the connection, against a URL endpoint.

Create a separate operation component for each interaction of your integration. Refer to the web service client's technical resources and be familiar with the data of the systems to be integrated.

All Web Services connector calls consist of a request message and a response message. For all client operations, send request XML data to the connector that corresponds with the defined XML profile.

When getting data from the web service, the request message contains selection criteria; the response message contains the resulting data records. When sending data to the web service, the request message contains the data records to save; the response contains the transaction status with any error messages.

Often, request documents are the destination output of a map. Alternatively, you can supply static or dynamic request values by setting parameters on the outbound connector or on the Start step's Parameterâ€™s tab within the process.


:::note

Because the types of messages and request/response XML profiles are different for each web service, you should obtain the specific web service documentation for mapping to or from the web service.

:::

The Web Services SOAP Client operation supports the Execute action, which retrieves data from and sends data to a web services SOAP client application. The executions are defined by the cached WSDL URL during the import \(browse\) process. A new import is required to update the cache.

## Options tab 

Click **Import Operation**, then use the Import wizard to select the object with which you want to integrate. The following table describes the field definitions for the Execute action:

**Object** - 
Defines the object with which you want to integrate and which was selected in the Import Wizard.

import TrackingDir from './_TrackObject.md'

<TrackingDir />

import ReturnErrRes from './_ReturnResponse.md'

<ReturnErrRes />

**Expose Request Envelope** - 
If selected \(the default\), the request profile contains the whole SOAP envelope.

**Expose Response Envelope** - 
If selected, the response profile contains the whole SOAP envelope without breaking up individual objects. This setting is cleared by default.


:::note

Exposing the full SOAP envelope enables you to read and write SOAP headers.

:::

**Attachment Cache** - 
Specifies the document cache from which MIME attachments are taken. The document cache component must contain a single index containing a dynamic document property named `WSS_ROOT_DOCUMENT_ID`.

For more information about how to transmit attachments with SOAP messages, including using the **Attachment Cache** to store and retrieve attachments, see the related Boomi Community Article.
