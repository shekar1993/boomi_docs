You can download shared web server log files if your account owns the local Atom, Molecule, or Atom Cloud, or if your account has access to the private Atom Cloud.

The server logs that you download are specific to your account.

1.  Go to **Manage** \> **Atom Management**.

2.  Select the Atom, Molecule, or Cloud from the list on the left.

3.  In the **Log Files** panel, select the date of the logs that you need from the calendar or use the format yyyy-MM-dd. A valid date is no later than the current date and no earlier than the latest purge date.

    If you select a date outside the valid date range, a warning message appears. You can change the date or keep it. If no logs are available for the selected date, a message will appear after you click **Download**. The dates and times in these log files are based on the JVM’s default time zone.

4.  Select **Shared Web Server Logs**.

5.  Click **Download**.

    The log files are downloaded to the default directory that your browser uses. The dates and times in these log files are based on the JVM’s default time zone.

6.  Open or save the file.
