Add published components to an integration pack on the **Deploy** \> **Integration Packs** page to make them shareable to an environment for use by managed accounts.

## About this task

Components must first be packaged from the [Packaged Components page](../Deployment/int-Packaged_components_page_36b36378-4f73-4ad8-bac8-b72e87ceee93.md) in order to be added as integration packs, and must be marked shareable when the packaged was created.

## Procedure

1.  In the Integration Packs page, select the integration pack that you want to add packaged components to.

2.  Under the Packaged Components heading, click the **Add Packaged Component** button.

    The Add Packages to Integration Pack dialog opens.

3. **Optional:** To filter the list of packaged components, type in the **Filter Components** field.

    As you type, the list is filtered to include only components whose names partially or completely match the typed characters.

    To discontinue filtering and restore the unfiltered list, click ![Clear filters.](../Images/main-ic-x-white-in-gray-circle-16_0abafeee-d5e7-4888-9bfb-475b11b6d00f.jpg).

4.  Select the check box for each packaged component that you want to add to the selected integration pack.

    You can add a maximum of 100 packaged components. The most recent shareable version of each packaged component is added to the integration pack.

5.  Click **Add n Selected Packages**.

    The dialog closes, and the newly added packages appear in the Packaged Components list.
