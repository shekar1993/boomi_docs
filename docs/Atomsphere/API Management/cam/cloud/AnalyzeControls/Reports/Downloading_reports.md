The Reports tab allows you to download all reports CSV files. The **Download CSV** button (![](../../Images/download_csv.jpg)) is displayed below reports on all pages. By clicking this button, you can download the data included in the report as a plain text file with comma separated values. The downloaded file with .csv extension is supported by almost all spreadsheet and database management software.
