Create and automatically deploy a release to the development environment.

## Creating a release

To create a release:

1.  Open the flow canvas for the flow that you would like to create a release for.
2.  Click the **Build** icon in the canvas options menu to open the **Build Flow** form.
3.  Enter a name for the new release into the **Add to release** field, and click **Create "\[name\]"** in the release drop-down menu.
4.  Add any notes about the flow build into the **Build Notes** field.
5.  Click **Build Flow** to build the flow and add it to the newly created release.
6.  The new release is automatically deployed to the development environment.

    -   You can continue to build flows and add them to the release. See [Adding flows to a release](flo-Environments-using_9a8bd4c5-2b42-47fb-bf70-16c4e2ae3721.md).

    -   You can promote the release to the next environment. See [Promoting a release](flo-Environments-promoting-releases_85e7790e-d62e-4778-a54f-b8ed1c7bc7bb.md).
