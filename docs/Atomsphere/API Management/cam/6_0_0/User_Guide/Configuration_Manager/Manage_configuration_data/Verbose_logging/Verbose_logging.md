The Verbose Logging feature enables you to debug the API in terms of the request sent to , (for example, InboundRequest), a request sent to the backend (for example, InboundProcessed(TargetRequest)), a response received from the backend (for example, OutboundResponse(TargetResponse)), and a response sent back to the client (for example, OutboundProcessed). Verbose logging also provides a feature to filter the API logs by different parameters such as service, endpoint, API keys, and duration. 

:::note

To enable the functionality, make sure that you change the value of verboseLog from disable to enable in the values.yaml file.
