Users can remove themselves as Administrators from an Organization.

CAUTION:

Leaving an Organization permanently removes your Administrator user role and privileges from the Organization. If you wish to rejoin an Organization that you have left, you will need to request a new invitation from the Organization Administrator.

## Leaving an Organization

To leave an Organization:

1.  Navigate to the **Organization Settings** page. See [Organization Settings page for Organization Administrators](flo-Organizations_Page_Administrators_8c6caca0-abab-41b2-8469-3f07ecd02ec6.md).
2.  Click **Leave this Organization**.
3.  The **Leave Organization** form is displayed:
    -   Click **Confirm** to leave the Organization.

    -   Click **Cancel** to cancel the leave request and return to the **Organization Settings** page.

4.  If you have confirmed the leave request, your user account is removed as an Organization Administrator from the Organization.
    -   The **Organization Settings** page updates to display the options available to a standard user. See [Organization Settings page](flo-Organizations_Page_5d231fef-6306-42be-83b1-606ea13293df.md).

    -   An email is sent to the email address associated with your user account to inform you that your user account has been removed as an Administrator from the Organization.


:::note

Your tenant will still remain in the Organization. Tenants can only be removed from an Organization by an Organization Administrator. See [Removing tenants from an Organization](flo-Organizations_Removing_Tenants_114becc7-aabe-4e06-8528-70b5d6dce067.md).
