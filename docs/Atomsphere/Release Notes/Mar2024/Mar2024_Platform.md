**Deferred**: Subsequent to the March 2024 Runtime release, features and fixes for the March platform release are postponed and will be rescheduled.

**We added these features:**

- Boomi GPT now supports dark mode when you select Dark Theme in the platform Preferences screen. (BI-3262)

- Improved how your Atom and the Platform communicate to reduce your UI response times and launch Integration processes faster. This new communication protocol will be disabled initially, then phased in gradually over time. Contact your Customer Success partner if you are interested in being an early adapter. (PS-3075)

  This feature is in the Runtime release. 

- Removed the **Home** button from the top navigation bar. You can click on the Boomi logo to return to the Platform home page. (UU-3540, UU-3537)

**We fixed these issues:**

- Boomi GPT no longer hides lengthy conversation text behind the prompt window. (BI-3799)

- Boomi GPT no longer designs an integration when you enter only an application name in the prompt window. (BI-4355)

- Improved how trusted IP addresses are validated to address security vulnerabilities. (ADSEC-1914)

  This feature is in the Runtime release.
