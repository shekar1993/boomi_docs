## Searching/filtering types

The **Search** field allows you to search for and filter which types are shown in the table.

This is useful if you have a large number of types, or wish to quickly search for a specific type.

1.  Enter the text into the **Search** field that you wish to filter the table by. Partial search terms can be used, for example, entering "Doc" will filter the table so that all/only types containing "Doc" in their name are shown.
2.  Click the **Search** icon to perform the search.

## Creating a new custom Type

As well as managing existing types on this page and types created as part of a installation, you can also create a new custom type:

1.  Click **New Type**. See [Creating a Type](t-flo-Types_Creating_a8b56d7f-4f20-4a98-b730-6f21b2bd5bfc.md).
