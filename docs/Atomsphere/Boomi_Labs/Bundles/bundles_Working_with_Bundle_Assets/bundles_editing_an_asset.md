You can edit asset details if you want to modify the asset details. You can only edit the details of assets for Bundles that you have created.

To edit an asset from a Bundle:
1. In the **Assets** tab, select the asset you want to edit in the Bundle and click ![](../../images_bundles/img_bundles_edit_icon.png).
 
    A confirmation dialog opens. 
2. Click **Edit** to confirm.
