Easily delete a locally-installed Atom, Molecule, or Cloud Molecule by running the uninstaller program.

The uninstaller completely removes the Atom, Molecule, or Cloud Molecule and associated files from the machine. The files are also removed from the Atom Management and Process Reporting pages. You can also remove a locally-installed Atom, Molecule, or Cloud Molecule by deleting it from the Atom Management page.

:::caution

Deleting an Atom, Molecule, or Cloud Molecule deletes all process execution history and data records. This means you can no longer view results for processes executed on this Atom, Molecule, or Cloud Molecule on the Process Reporting page.

:::

To delete a Cloud Molecule, there cannot be any additional Atoms installed on the Cloud Molecule’s primary account. To delete an Atom Cloud, uninstall or delete all of the Cloud Molecules from the Atom Cloud’s primary account. Unless you do this uninstall/deletion, you are prevented from deleting the Atom Cloud.

If the Cloud Molecule is shared with child accounts, when you delete the Cloud Molecule it is no longer available to the child accounts. Any Atoms that the child accounts installed on the Cloud Molecule are no longer available either.
