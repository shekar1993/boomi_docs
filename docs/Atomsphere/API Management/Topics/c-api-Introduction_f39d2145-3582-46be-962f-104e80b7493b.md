Boomi API Management offers extensive features covering the entire API lifecycle, enabling organizations to create, publish and centrally manage APIs on-premise or in the cloud.

This unified capability makes it easier and faster to create, distribute and govern the range of APIs that organizations increasingly recognize as essential to accelerating business-to-consumer \(B2C\), business to business \(B2B\), and mobile interactions.
