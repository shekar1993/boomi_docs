Use the Taleo REST connector to move data into and out of the Taleo Business Edition application by using its public REST API.

As a Taleo user, you can use the Taleo REST connector to integrate any on-premise applications and legacy systems. You can also use this connector to integrate Taleo Business Edition with other On Demand or SaaS-based applications such as Intacct, Salesforce, NetSuite, etc.

## Connector configuration 

To configure a connector to communicate with Taleo Business Edition through its REST API, set up two components:

-   Taleo REST connection

-   Taleo REST operation


## Supported editions 

This connector supports version 12.5 and future versions of the Taleo Business Edition REST API.

## Prerequisites 
Either create a new user within Taleo, or use an existing user to access the Taleo REST API with this connector. Boomi Integration connectivity is subject to the same access control restrictions as defined within Taleo. Validate the controls you will need the REST API to use and define a user with the appropriate controls.
