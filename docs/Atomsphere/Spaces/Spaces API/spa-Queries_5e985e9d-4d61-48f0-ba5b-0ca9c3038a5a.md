You can use the Spaces service GraphQL queries to request data, such as a list of all Spaces created by an account, get a list of all accounts that are associated with a Space, etc *.* The query describes the data that you want to fetch from the Boomi GraphQL server. When you send a query, you ask for units of data by *field*. These fields map to the same field in the JSON response you receive from the server. Here is a list of queries that you can perform on *platform.boomi.com/graphql*.
