Go to the Process Library page **Manage** \> **Process Library** to display the Packaged Processes list.

If you have a large number of shareable packaged processes, you might see a small loading icon for a moment before all processes appear. The list displays, in alphabetical order, all of the packaged processes that are marked as shareable in the current account. If some processes are stored in folders, the folders appear alphabetically as well. All of the folders are expanded by default so that you can see all of the processes.

Next to each packaged process component and folder there is a check box, which is used to select and publish multiple processes. But first you might want to filter or search the list to find the packaged process component that you want to publish.

:::note

For Legacy deployment, API Service components can also be published and this list is called Publishable Components.
