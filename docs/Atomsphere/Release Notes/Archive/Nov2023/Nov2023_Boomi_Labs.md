## Bundles

We are excited to announce the release of **Bundles**â€”a streamlined mechanism to create and share multi-product solutions. This release marks a significant milestone in our journey towards a more cohesive and community-based platform.

**Bundles** allows you to create reusable templates by adding one or more Boomi assets into one package. You can then install the solution into your account at any time or share it with others.

Key Highlights:

- Easy-to-use interface to Install, Share, Edit, and View Bundles.
- Ability to create multi-product solutions with one or more Boomi assets such as Integration Components, Flows, and Custom Assets, which can be used for uploading files including ReadMe docs, sample data, and configuration instructions.
- Open sharing capabilities across any account or as public Bundles available to all Boomi customers.


We invite you to explore the full capabilities of **Bundles** and discover how it can elevate your solution-building and sharing capabilities on the Boomi Enterprise Platform with anyone, anywhere.
