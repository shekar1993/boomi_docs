## API Reference

The [Boomi Flow API Reference](https://manywho.github.io/docs-api/) provides information on the available endpoints in the Flow RESTful API, including parameters and response data format. As Flow is based on an [API-first architecture](./c-flo-Techref_Architecture_b7cbf7a7-bcd0-4d1c-b926-69854df699ec.md),many of the operations performed within Flow can be accessed through this API.
