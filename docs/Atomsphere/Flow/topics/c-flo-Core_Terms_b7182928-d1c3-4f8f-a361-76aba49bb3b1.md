## Assets

Assets are resources that can be used in a flow web application, such as images, presentations, spreadsheets, text files, stylesheets or code snippets for example. See [c-flo-Assets\_7d21c82d-c700-437d-bdaa-ae4b0716726b.md](c-flo-Assets_7d21c82d-c700-437d-bdaa-ae4b0716726b.md).

## Authentication

Authentication is the process by which a user \(or groups of users\) is identified by an app. applications typically use a username and password combination for authentication. You can also build public apps that do not require any authentication to run. See [c-flo-Service\_Integrations\_cac4d712-9607-4f24-8e70-aae48ceb27b9.md](c-flo-Service_Integrations_cac4d712-9607-4f24-8e70-aae48ceb27b9.md).

## Bindings

Aligning a value used in your flow with a record type from an external system. See [c-flo-Types\_Bindings\_d7c6499e-7796-491f-bdcf-0c41f65bce9e.md](c-flo-Types_Bindings_d7c6499e-7796-491f-bdcf-0c41f65bce9e.md).

## Bootstrap

Created at Twitter, Bootstrap is an open-source framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web projects. Players in are based on the Bootstrap 3 framework, and can be customized as required.

-   See [www.getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/) to learn more about the Bootstrap framework.

-   See [c-flow-Players\_931f82a8-0725-4dc3-b965-f606330dc5a6.md](c-flow-Players_931f82a8-0725-4dc3-b965-f606330dc5a6.md) to learn more about using players to deliver your web applications.


## Business Rules

Business rules allow you to define different outcomes or actions based on whether the conditions specified in the rule have been met. Business rules are typically applied in a flow to determine which path a flow should take if there are multiple outcomes available, but can also be implemented on a user interface, data, or validation. See [c-flo-Canvas\_Business\_Rules\_e8860ab5-4260-449c-b72d-137d9902baec.md](c-flo-Canvas_Business_Rules_e8860ab5-4260-449c-b72d-137d9902baec.md)

## Canvas

The flow canvas provides a visual drag-and-drop interface to work in when building a flow, allowing you to add 'map elements' to the canvas, which can then be configured, linked together and positioned to define the workflow of your flow. See [c-flo-Flow\_Canvas\_f063ba9b-b7f4-4484-8242-d51d4fb40fa6.md](c-flo-Flow_Canvas_f063ba9b-b7f4-4484-8242-d51d4fb40fa6.md).

allow you to connect your flows to external applications, such as third-party APIs and data sources. They can also be used to extend the functionality of a flow, such as adding authorization restrictions and scheduling tasks. also supports connecting to processes built in the Boomi AtomSphere platform, provided the processes are using the [Flow Services component](http://help.boomi.com/atomsphere/GUID-524907B3-630E-4AAF-A18A-BF26A29E78BC.html). See [c-flo-Service\_Integrations\_cac4d712-9607-4f24-8e70-aae48ceb27b9.md](c-flo-Service_Integrations_cac4d712-9607-4f24-8e70-aae48ceb27b9.md).

## CRUD

"CRUD" is an acronym that stands for "create, read, update, and delete", representing the four basic operations of a persistent database.

## CSS

"CSS" is an acronym that stands for "Cascading Style Sheets", a language that describes the style and presentation of an HTML or XML document. CSS is helpful in separating the content of a flow \(both data and metadata\) from its style \(or how the various elements are rendered\). You can use CSS to customize the player your app is run in, to change the look and feel of your app as you like. See [c-flo-Players\_Stylesheets\_ebaf21f6-277a-4a8e-8f12-e6d48c2a99be.md](c-flo-Players_Stylesheets_ebaf21f6-277a-4a8e-8f12-e6d48c2a99be.md).

## Decision

Decision map elements allow conditional routing within a flow, for example where one incoming path gets split into two or more outgoing paths, based on pre-conditions. This is achieved using outcomes and business rules within a flow. See [c-flo-ME\_Decision\_9ca6d47d-cb8f-40dd-8514-381dca308957.md](c-flo-ME_Decision_9ca6d47d-cb8f-40dd-8514-381dca308957.md).

## Default

A default is a pre-determined data or setting you use in a flow. For example, when you are creating values, you have the option of assigning default data to the values while you are creating them. See [c-flo-Values\_f83f964c-1348-475d-80b1-480daef433f7.md](c-flo-Values_f83f964c-1348-475d-80b1-480daef433f7.md).

## Flow

Flows are built in and allow you to deliver applications to your users using a drag-and-drop, low-code development environment. A flow is the JSON metadata definition of your web application’s features and user interfaces. This metadata is turned into a usable application at runtime using an HTML/JavaScript ‘player'. See [c-flo-Flows\_Overview\_263d2c58-b3b9-463b-92c3-b828eb3362ea.md](c-flo-Flows_Overview_263d2c58-b3b9-463b-92c3-b828eb3362ea.md).

## IPaaS

Integration platform as a Service \(iPaaS\) delivers a cloud service for application, data, process, and service-oriented architecture \(SOA\) integration scenarios. It is a multi-tenant platform that supports cloud-to-cloud, cloud-to-on-premises, on-premises-to-on-premises and B2B integration. It supports real-time integration and scales to meet the high-volume demands of mobile, extract, transform and load \(ETL\) and electronic data interchange \(EDI\) environments. Boomi introduced the industry’s first iPaaS in 2008. You can find more information at [https://boomi.com/integration/what-is-ipaas/](https://boomi.com/integration/what-is-ipaas/).

## Join URI

A Join URI allows you to share the running instance of a flow with multiple users. Each flow is able to automatically generate a link, which allows someone to invite collaborators or rejoin the specific flow at a later date. This is a system value called the $JoinUri. After starting a flow the URL in the address bar will change to a Join URI. See [r-flo-Values\_System\_State\_Values\_0e184acc-ec85-4922-b06b-07a5d6966fa0.md](r-flo-Values_System_State_Values_0e184acc-ec85-4922-b06b-07a5d6966fa0.md).

## JSON

"JSON" is an acronym that stands for "JavaScript Object Notation", a text-based data interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. The JSON format is often used to transmit structured data over a network connection. It is similar to XML and is often used as an alternative to XML. converts map elements of a flow into JSON formatted metadata. See [c-flo-ME\_Metadata\_b3d64956-567e-4dbc-92b9-3f174004d5ba.md](c-flo-ME_Metadata_b3d64956-567e-4dbc-92b9-3f174004d5ba.md).

## Map element

Map elements are added to the flow canvas to define the workflow and behaviour of a flow. Map elements can be thought of as the 'building blocks' that make up a flow on the canvas; each map element provides access to a different feature that can be added into a flow, such as showing a screen to a user, obtaining user input, updating and manipulating data, and so on. Connecting map elements with outcomes allows you to determine the path \(or paths\) that a flow will take. See [c-flo-Map\_Elements\_94361918-d868-4422-9bd4-94da7c46cd0f.md](c-flo-Map_Elements_94361918-d868-4422-9bd4-94da7c46cd0f.md).

## Metadata

Metadata is data about the data and elements in your flow. For example, if you have a Step element, its metadata will include the date it was created, the date it was modified, who created the element, and so on. separates the metadata of a flow from its data, making it easy and simple to update or localize content. See [c-flo-ME\_Metadata\_b3d64956-567e-4dbc-92b9-3f174004d5ba.md](c-flo-ME_Metadata_b3d64956-567e-4dbc-92b9-3f174004d5ba.md).

## Navigation

A navigation element allows you build a nested hierarchical menu that lets a user navigate to a particular map element \(such as a page\) from anywhere within the flow. When the user selects a particular menu item, the flow executes the linked map element. See [c-flo-Navigation\_871ceb19-15cf-4fe6-bc34-7e07acbf5878.md](c-flo-Navigation_871ceb19-15cf-4fe6-bc34-7e07acbf5878.md).

## Player

A Boomi Flow player allows you to define and generate a user interface for your flows. Once you have built a flow, a 'player' is then used to provide a user interface for the flow to your end users; Boomi Flow uses an API-first architecture, and players serve as a way of running and rendering these flow API's into a user interface. The platform API's define the user interface elements for a player, and the player in turn generates the interface using this platform definition. [c-flow-Players\_931f82a8-0725-4dc3-b965-f606330dc5a6.md](c-flow-Players_931f82a8-0725-4dc3-b965-f606330dc5a6.md).

## Runtime data

Runtime data is anything that is used specifically at runtime in a flow, such as states, invoker logs, user tokens, and so on. See [c-flo-Flows\_Flow\_States\_32129a7c-a51a-4566-a406-3a66906818c6.md](c-flo-Flows_Flow_States_32129a7c-a51a-4566-a406-3a66906818c6.md).

## Snapshot

A flow snapshot catches the state of a flow at a particular point in time. For example, when you run a flow, a snapshot is taken of the current version of the flow. Snapshots of your flow can be activated using the **Flow Properties** form. See [c-flo-Flow\_Properties\_b74d944d-9fec-43da-9ae3-fe0a5a370d00.md](c-flo-Flow_Properties_b74d944d-9fec-43da-9ae3-fe0a5a370d00.md).

## Subflows

Flows can be called by other flows as 'subflows', allowing you to re-use flows across multiple workflows. See [c-flo-Subflows\_ca879fac-5941-44d3-87df-69b97ac5c034.md](c-flo-Subflows_ca879fac-5941-44d3-87df-69b97ac5c034.md).

## Subtenant

A subtenant is a new tenant created under the same tenant account. Subtenants can be used to structure and organise your flows, for example by using different subtenants for different divisions of your company, or for separating out deployment environments into Development, Staging, and Production. See [c-flo-Tenants\_770f70ef-b441-4f1b-b565-2f87430e28f2.md](c-flo-Tenants_770f70ef-b441-4f1b-b565-2f87430e28f2.md).

## Swimlane

Swimlane elements are used to group and restrict access to elements in a flow application for specific users and groups requiring different authorization privileges. For example, you could create an 'employee' swimlane and a 'manager' swimlane for a flow application that approves expense submissions. See [c-flo-ME\_Swimlane\_872bacc3-8123-4bfa-9b87-8bc3ee9d8beb.md](c-flo-ME_Swimlane_872bacc3-8123-4bfa-9b87-8bc3ee9d8beb.md).

## System flow

A system flow is a workflow that is automatically implemented by a software system, without the need for human intervention. For example, when you register a new tenant with Boomi Flow, the registration process \(provisioning a tenant, sending you a confirmation email, etc.\) is handled by a system flow.

## Tenant

A tenant is a user of a software application that serves multiple other users as well. Each tenant’s information is invisible to other tenants. When you create a Boomi Flow account, you are assigned a tenant where all your flows, values, integrations and content are stored. See [c-flo-Tenants\_770f70ef-b441-4f1b-b565-2f87430e28f2.md](c-flo-Tenants_770f70ef-b441-4f1b-b565-2f87430e28f2.md).

## Types

Types are used to define a 'profile' and structure for data used in Boomi Flow, allowing for efficient data organisation and scalability when working with complex values. A type uses 'Properties' to build and define the structure of the data that it is associated with. [c-flo-Types\_d429840a-ffa4-47c5-8131-5411965e422c.md](c-flo-Types_d429840a-ffa4-47c5-8131-5411965e422c.md).

## Values

Values are containers used to store data that can then be used in your flows. This data can be numbers, text, dates, instances of a type \(say, Type: Customer\), or another value. See [c-flo-Values\_f83f964c-1348-475d-80b1-480daef433f7.md](c-flo-Values_f83f964c-1348-475d-80b1-480daef433f7.md).

## Webhooks

Webhooks are an HTTP POST callback request, and occurs when something specific happens. You can use webhooks to trigger an event in Boomi Flow when something changes in a third-party integration you use \(or vice versa\). For example, when a file is uploaded in Box, you can use webhooks to trigger a text message being sent out from the Boomi Flow app. See [c-flo-ME\_Message\_342e9efb-0f11-4083-a2dc-195d52d1f939.md](c-flo-ME_Message_342e9efb-0f11-4083-a2dc-195d52d1f939.md).
