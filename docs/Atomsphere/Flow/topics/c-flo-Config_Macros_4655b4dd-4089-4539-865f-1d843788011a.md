Add a macro to an operator map element, to create or update values in a flow.

Macros are shared elements created on the **Macros** page. See [Macros](c-flo-Macros_b108573d-8668-4d4f-aab3-79fb49adcc3f.md).

Macros can only be added to [Operator map elements](c-flo-ME_Operator_7d40c8c0-1da1-4acc-a659-18e534029ae6.md).

## Adding a macro to an operator map element 
To add a macro to an operator map element:

1.  Open an operator map element.
2.  Click **Add Macro** to open the **Macro** page.
3.  Select the macro you wish to run from the **Which Macro do you want to run?** drop-down menu.
4.  Click **Add** to save the macro and return to the configuration panel. The new macro is shown in the table of operations and macros.
5.  Click **Save** to save any changes you have made to the operator map element, including the macros you have added.

If you have added multiple operations/macros, use the **Move up** and **Move down** arrow icons in the **Actions** column to define the order in which operations/macros are performed. Items at the top of the list are performed first, continuing down through the list in sequence.
