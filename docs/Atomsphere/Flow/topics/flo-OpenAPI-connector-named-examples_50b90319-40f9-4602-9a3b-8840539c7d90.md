# Choosing one of a list of named examples

In this example, a list of named examples are referenced in the OpenAPI document schema.

When configuring examples, it may be useful to have multiple examples defined for a single endpoint and then switch between them by changing a single line of configuration, instead of refining an example.

This is achieved by providing the name of the desired example.

In this example, note line 18 where the desired exampleâ€™s name is provided.
