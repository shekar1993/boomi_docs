The Oracle CRM On Demand connection represents a single instance, including sign-in credentials.

If you use multiple services, you need a separate connection component for each. You can pair this connection with different Oracle CRM On Demand operations to perform a unique action against an Oracle CRM On Demand instance.

When you start to build your processes, you can set up the connection to point to a sandbox instance by using the URL in the connection. When you are ready to run the processes in a production environment, you only need to change the connectionâ€™s URL to point to the production instance URL. When the process runs, it uses the new URL.
