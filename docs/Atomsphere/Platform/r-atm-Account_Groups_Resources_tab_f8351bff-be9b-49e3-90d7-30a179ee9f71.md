Primary account administrators can control resources by account group on the Resources tab.

Users in the account group have access to the resources assigned to the account group.

The following list describes example use cases for each resource:

- **Clouds** - Set up multiple private clouds and assign each to its own account group.

- **Connectors** - Attach private production SDK connectors to an account group to control account and user access to them.

- **Roles** - Add custom roles in a primary account and share them with an account group so that they can be assigned to users in the accounts.

- **Published Processes** - Assign published processes to an account group. Assigned processes can be installed in member accounts.

- **Integration Packs** - Assign integration packs to an account group.

- **Models** - Share Boomi [Boomi DataHub models](../Master%20Data%20Hub/Modeling/c-mdm-Modeling_079b48bb-6c87-431f-ac30-5c7ed5d57814.md) with member accounts for their use in the service as templates.

   :::note

   The **Models** section in the **Resources** tab is visible only if you are using a primary account in which is enabled. If you would like to enable in your account, contact a Sales Representative.
