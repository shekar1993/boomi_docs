The Teqtron Agile PLM connection contains login credentials to access a single Agile PLM system \(Both the Agile content service/SOAP as well as Agile PLM SFTP server\).

## Connection tab

To connect to multiple agile systems, use a separate connection for each system and configure credentials accordingly. Pair a single connection with different available operations to perform desired actions on the Agile PLM system.

The Teqtron Agile PLM connection involves connection with the Agile PLM system, as well as the SFTP server allocated for the Agile PLM system. These settings are common, and are accessible by all operations built into the connector. The Agile PLM connection settings are primarily used to connect with the Agile PLM system’s application interface service operations. The SFTP connection settings are used by the Get and Send operations on the SFTP server allocated for the Agile PLM system.
