The **Sources** page provides an easy way to view the list of domains to which any source is attached.

## Procedure

1.  In the **Sources** page, click **Show Attachments** in the list entry for the source.

    The list of domains to which the source is attached appears below the list entry. For each domain the name of the hosting repository and the status of the source with regard to the domain are shown. Each domain name and source status indicator is a link to the repository page and the Sources tab for the domain. Each repository name is a link to the corresponding repository page.

2. **Optional:** To hide the list, click **Hide Attachments**.
