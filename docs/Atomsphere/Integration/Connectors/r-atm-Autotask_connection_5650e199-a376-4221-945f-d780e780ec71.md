The Autotask connection represents a single Autotask account, including sign in information.

## Connection tab 




**Web Services Site** - 
The URL to the Autotask web services. New connections, by default, set the URL to: https://webservices.autotask.net/atservices/1.6

CAUTION:

On December 31, 2021, Autotask deactivated version 1.5 of their API, and the version is not supported. For backward compatibility, the connector continues to support the legacy URL https://webservices.autotask.net/atservices/1.5. However, encourages you to update your existing connections and use version 1.6. After updating the URL to the 1.6 version, save the connection to us the new version in your process.

**User** - 
Your Autotask user name.

**Password** - 
 The password for the user.
