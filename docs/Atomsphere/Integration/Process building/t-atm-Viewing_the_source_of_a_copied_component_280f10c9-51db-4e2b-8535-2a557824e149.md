When you are viewing or editing a copied component, if you have access rights to the account from which a component was copied, you can view the source component.

1.  In the Component Explorer, navigate to the folder containing the component.

2.  Double-click the component.

    The component opens on a tab.

3.  Click **![](../Images/main-ic-document-with-clock-16_2b85ed07-7ace-4a55-a4f7-24617309d6ba.jpg) Revision History**.

    The Revision History dialog opens showing each revision and, if you have access rights to the source account, a Copied From icon ![](../Images/main-ic-document-with-clock-16_2b85ed07-7ace-4a55-a4f7-24617309d6ba.jpg).

4.  Click **![icon](../Images/main-ic-document-with-clock-16_2b85ed07-7ace-4a55-a4f7-24617309d6ba.jpg) Copied From** next to a revision number.

    As you pause on the Copied From icon, the location from which the component was copied is displayed. When you click the icon, the source component opens on a new tab.
