You can remove custom JAR files from a Custom Library component, but you should not do so if the component is currently deployed.

## Procedure

1.  Open the Custom Library component.

2.  Pause on the name of a JAR file and click ![Clicking the trash can icon for a custom JAR file selects the file for removal.](../Images/main-ic-trashcan-gray-16_607066a6-af16-43bb-b12e-6ac8ad67304e.jpg).

    The file is removed from the **Included JAR Files** list and returned to the selection list.

3.  After you select all of the JAR files that you want to remove from the Custom Library component, click **Save**.
