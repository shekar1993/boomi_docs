### Accelerate data mapping within Boomi DesignGen

After generating an integration with Boomi DesignGen, Boomi Pathfinder can map profiles for you. It suggests mappings based on over 300 million common integration patterns. To see these suggested mappings in Integration, click **Profile Mapping**. In a future release, a tag will show in Boomi GPT next to a response indicating when Boomi Pathfinder maps profiles. Read [Boomi DesignGen](/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/atm-BoomiAI_Boomi_DesignGen.md) to learn more.
