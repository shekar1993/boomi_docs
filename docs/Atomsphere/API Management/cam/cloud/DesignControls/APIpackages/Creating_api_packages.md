A Package is a collection of Plans and is used to manage similar Plans with the objective of understanding usage patterns by different types of developers as well as aid in the upgrading/downgrading process. After creating a Package, you can set the notification settings and the key properties, both of which will be applicable to all Plans associated with the Package. After a Package is created, multiple Plans can be created in the Package.
