# Uninstalling integration

You can uninstall a single-install or multi-install integration if you no longer want to use it. Uninstalling completely removes the integration along with the data, configuration, and integration activity associated with it. However, you can uninstall an integration from a specific environment instead of completely uninstalling it.

To uninstall an integration from all environments:

1. Sign in to the Space User portal.
2. Enable the **Show Installed Only** view to access the installed integration.
3. Search for the integration you want to uninstall and click the Edit icon.

A confirmation dialog opens.

1. Click **Uninstall** to confirm.

5.  In the confirmation dialog that opens, click **Uninstall Integration** to confirm.
