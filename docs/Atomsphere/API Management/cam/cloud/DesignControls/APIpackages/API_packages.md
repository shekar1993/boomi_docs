The **API Packages** tab enables creating API access Plans that can be tailored to groups of developers or partners, without any coding. Each API Plan constitutes a set of entitlement rules, limits, and filters that might be enforced when developers make calls to specific API methods or resources. An administrator can group related Plans into a Package, similar to how your cell phone or cable provider might bundle their services, thereby enabling easy management of Package Keys, including simple upgrading or downgrading of service. API Packager is a fast, easy, and efficient mode of offering APIs as a product: bundling together multiple services, endpoints, and methods and, with the addition of Advanced Packager, restricting access down to the individual call and data elements. The flexibility of API Packager enables you to alter how your developers interact with your APIs, without coding, through a simple, easy to use UI. 

The landing page of the **API Packages** page displays a navigable list of API Packages. This list is paginated such that the API Packages are displayed in groups of 50. You can use the navigation buttons at the bottom of the list to navigate to the rest of the API list pages. If less than 50 APIs are registered, the navigation buttons are not visible.
