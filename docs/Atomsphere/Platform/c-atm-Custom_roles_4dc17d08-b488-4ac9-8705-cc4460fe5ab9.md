Administrators with access to Advanced User Security can create custom roles and assign privileges to them.

If the available user roles and their assigned privileges do not match your work flow, an administrator can create custom roles and assign to them the privileges that you need. Custom roles can inherit one of the available roles and its privileges along with any additional privileges that you assign, or the custom role can be unrelated to an available role and can consist of the privileges that you select.

:::note

This feature is part of Advanced User Security, which is available in the Enterprise and Enterprise Plus Editions, and as an add-on to the Professional and Professional Plus Editions. Consult with your Boomi account representative to enable this functionality.
