Custom scripts enable you to perform custom manipulations and logic to accomplish unique and advanced requirements that fall outside the native functionality of Integration. You can save a custom script as a Scripting component, which makes that script reusable in multiple map functions or processes.

There are two types of Scripting components:

-   Map Scripting components are available for selection in the custom scripting steps of map functions.

-   Process Scripting components are available for selection in the custom scripting steps of Data Process steps.


You can create Scripting components in the same way that you create other types of components: from the **Build** pageâ€™s **Create New** button, **Welcome** tab, or **Component Explorer**; or from any process step that contains an icon for creating a new component ![+](../Images/main-ic-plus-sign-white-in-green-circle-16_4dc8c5f3-e893-4aef-ade2-0b7afe9476c1.jpg).

You can also save an existing inline custom script as a Scripting component from the Data Process step dialog or the Embedded Scripting dialog for a Map Function component.

Scripting components are deployed as part of any process in which they are referenced.
