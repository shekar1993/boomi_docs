In this section, spark lines are plotted on a graph to communicate the overall trend of the three categories: Successful Calls, Blocked Calls, and Other Responses. For more information, see [API Usage](../APIusage/API_usage.md).

:::note

This report displays data for a selected Package or an API unlike the [API Usage report on the Summary page](../API_usage_report_for_all_apis.md) that displays the data for all APIs.
