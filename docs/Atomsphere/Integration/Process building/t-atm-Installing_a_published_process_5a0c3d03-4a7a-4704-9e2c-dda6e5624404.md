    The Browse Process Library dialog opens. The published processes that are accessible to the account you are using are listed.

2.  Find the process that you want to install by doing one of the following:

    -   Browsing the list.

    -   Clicking **Search processes** and typing in the field to filter the list.

        As you type, the process list is filtered to include only processes whose names or descriptions match the typed characters partially or completely.

    -   Using the **Filter by Publisher list** to turn on the check boxes for the publishers whose processes you want to see.

3.  Click the **View** button for a process.

    The list is replaced by additional details about the selected process, including the date and time it was published, who published it, and a description \(if one was supplied\).

4.  Click **Install** from the process list or the process details.

    The process installation dialog is displayed with fields for specifying the installation folder and the local process name.

5.  In the **Select Installation Location** field, do one of the following:

    A copy of the published process are installed in the specified folder.

6.  In the **Process Name for Local Version** field, replace the name of the published process with the name that you want to assign to the locally installed copy of the process.

    If the process name you specify is the same as the name of an existing process in your account, the existing process is not overwritten. Instead the process you are installing has a number appended to the specified name when it is installed.

7.  Click **Install**.

    A copy of the selected process is installed and a confirmation is displayed.

    -   To open the newly installed process in the Build page, click **View Process**.
