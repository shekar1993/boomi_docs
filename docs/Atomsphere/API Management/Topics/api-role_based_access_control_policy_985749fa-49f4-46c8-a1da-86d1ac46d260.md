You can use the role-based access control policy to control access to a resource by specifying the required roles to access it. The policy can be configured to allow only incoming requests with at least one role matching the configured roles.

Role-based access can be configured in a policy rule or in the authentication source on a Gateway. To set up roles on a Gateway, see [this topic](docs/Atomsphere/API%20Management/Topics/r-api-Auth_Source_settings_for_Basic_Authentication_f84a524e-9874-45f4-8a79-c624529d79ba.md).

:::note If you have configured **Restrictions by Role** on the **Deployed API** screen, a role-based access control policy will be created as part of the standard policies.
