Reordering fields and field groups are drag-and-drop operations.

## Procedure

1.  In the **Fields** tab, drag and drop reorder icons ![](../Images/Common/main-ic-dots-16-gray-on-white_404b1c3f-e21a-4b67-ba76-65412d39eb70.jpg) for fields and field groups until they are in the desired order.

    ![Dragging the field Postal Code from its current location three fields below the field State.](../Images/Models/mdm-li-fields-reorder_7439150b-d694-4322-9a09-8da32fb8108a.jpg)

    As you drag a reorder icon, a dashed horizontal line dynamically shows the position into which the field or field group would be moved if you were to drop the icon at the pointer location.

    ![Dropping the field Postal Code immediately below the field State.](../Images/Models/mdm-li-fields-reordering_ad92702f-a33d-4e4b-982a-d4764e243877.jpg)

    When you change the position of a field group, its member fields move along with it.

    :::note
    
    The id field must be first and therefore does not have a reorder icon.
