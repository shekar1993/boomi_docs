An API definition is a set of configurable properties that specify the function of an API within the Traffic Manager. After creating API definitions, you can create endpoints and method definitions for the API. 

The following user roles can access the **API Definitions** tab: 

- Administrator

- API Manager 

The landing page of the **API Definitions** tab displays a navigable list of API definitions. This list is paginated such that the APIs are displayed in groups of 50. You can use the navigation buttons at the bottom of the list to navigate to the rest of the API list pages. If less than 50 APIs are registered, the navigation buttons are not visible.
