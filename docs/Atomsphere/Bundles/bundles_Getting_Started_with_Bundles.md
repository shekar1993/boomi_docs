Bundles are packages containing one or more Boomi product assets that can be shared and installed. They can also contain supporting materials that contain files such as documentation, images, or other resources for the Bundle consumer.

Ownership of the Bundle lies with the account. Each account user can view or own all the Bundles of the account, as the Bundle ownership depends directly on the account rather than the users. 

Bundles simplify the sharing capability across Boomi. It promotes sharing customized solutions with your team or others with ease as there is no limitation of an account and sub-account group structure for sharing assets. You can share Bundles with other accounts using their account ID or as a public URL to share with other Boomi users. 

Bundles are unmanaged solutions. Upon Bundle installation, you assume complete control over the assets within the Bundle without affecting the original source and, as a result, take full ownership of the installed copy of the Bundle asset(s). You can now configure and change the assets according to your needs.


## Key Terms

Here are some key terms that are helpful to know while getting started with Bundles:

* **Assets** are the various objects you can add to a Bundle, such as Integration, Flow, and Custom Assets. 

* **Flows** are created in Boomi Flow, a cloud-native, low-code application development platform for creating customer journeys and automating simple and sophisticated workflows that accelerate your business. See [Boomi Flow](/docs/Atomsphere/Flow/topics/c-flo-Getting_Started_f26280db-5b73-46dd-b087-4423f5dc6774.md) to learn more.

* **Packaged Components** are created by packaging deployable AtomSphere components such as processes, web services, process routes, or flow services components processes that you have built using Boomi Integration. Packaged Components give you greater control over the lifecycle and distribution of your processes and components. Whenever you create a new Packages Component, a new version of the Packaged Component is created. Note that a Packaged Component **does not** need to be deployed before adding to a Bundle
