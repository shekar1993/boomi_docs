You can reorder data elements by dragging and dropping.

## Procedure


1.  Open an EDI profile.

2.  Select a child loop, segment, or data element.

3.  Drag it to a new location in the tree.

    If the new location is valid, a yellow arrow icon, dashed line and yellow highlighting appear at the location and you can drop it at this location.

    If the new location is invalid, a red X ![Invalid location icon](../Images/main-ic-x-red-stylized-16_5cfc1d0e-0ef7-44cc-bacf-4b4116afca79.jpg) appears and you cannot drop it at this location.
