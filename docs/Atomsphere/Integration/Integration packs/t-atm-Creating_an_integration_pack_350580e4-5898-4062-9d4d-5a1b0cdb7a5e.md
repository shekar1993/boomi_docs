Create an integration pack on the **Manage** \> **Integration Packs** page to make single or multiple components shareable to managed accounts.

## Procedure

1.  In the Integration Packs page \(**Manage** \> **Integration Packs**\), click **Create Integration Pack**.

    The Create Integration Pack dialog opens.

2.  In the **Integration Pack Name** field, type a name for the integration pack.

3.  In the **Integration Pack Type** drop-down list, select one of the following:

    -   Single Attachment — You can install one instance of the integration pack per account.

    -   Multiple Attachments — You can install multiple instances of the integration pack per account.

    After you create an integration pack, you cannot change its type.

    **Note:** This list is present only if enables the multi-install integration packs in the account. Contact your Sales Representative if you want to enable this feature. You can create only Single Attachment integration packs if muti-install is not allowed.

    **Note:** Multi-install integration packs cannot include API Service components.

4. **Optional:**  In the **Description** field, type a description of the integration pack.

    The description can contain up to 500 characters.

5.  Click **Create Integration Pack**.

    The name of the newly created integration pack appears in the Integration Packs list.

## Next steps


After you create an integration pack, you need to add some combination of shareable packaged components \(processes and API Service components\) to the integration pack.
