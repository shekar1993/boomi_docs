If you no longer need a draft version of a model, you can remove it. If there is a previously published version of the model, removing the draft reverts the model to the last published version.

## Procedure

1.  In the model page, click **Remove Draft**.

    ![Clicking Remove Draft in a model page](../Images/Models/mdm-bt-model-remove_98b9f3b5-736b-4bad-a964-59857283a72e.jpg)

    A confirmation dialog appears.

2.  To confirm your request, click **OK**.

    Unsaved changes to the model are discarded; if the model was saved as a draft, the draft is discarded. Then the **Models** page loads.
