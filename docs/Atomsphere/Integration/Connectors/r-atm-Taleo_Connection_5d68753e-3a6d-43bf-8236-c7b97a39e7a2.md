The Taleo connection represents a single Taleo account, including login credentials.

To use multiple sites, you need a separate connection component for each. You can pair this connection with different Taleo operations to perform a unique action against a Taleo instance.

## Connection tab 

**Organization Code** - 
The company code of the Taleo customer.

**Login User Name** - 
 The user name for logging into the Taleo instance.

**Login Password** - 
 The password for logging into the Taleo instance

To understand how passwords are securely stored in a Connection component, see the [Password encryption security](../../Platform/c-atm-Password_Encryption_Security_89953624-ed1f-4c27-9b31-24f1bf2f2d74.md) topic.
