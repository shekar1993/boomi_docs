- Product Name	 : Cloud API Management - Local Edition
- Release Version	 : 5.6.2
- Release Date	 : September 2023


## Introduction 

Cloud API Management - Local Edition is a cloud-native
API gateway that can be deployed within a customer's datacenter
or on Cloud platforms.

Cloud API Management - Local Edition (hereinafter
referred to as "API Management - Local Edition" or "the Local
Edition") supports two mutually exclusive deployment modes,
both which allow customers to process API traffic within their
on-premises environment:
* Untethered, without any external dependencies
* Tethered, alongside Cloud API Management

In Tethered mode, Cloud API Management includes a
cloud-hosted Developer Portal, Administrative Control Center,
API Reporting and Analytics dashboard.

In Untethered mode, API Management - Local Edition includes a
locally deployed Developer Portal and Administrative Control
Center. Logs from Local Edition can be collected and forwarded
for downstream reporting and analytics via other
externally-available tools.

API Management - Local Edition is available to customers for
installation in container-based environments.


## Minimum Hardware Requirements

- CPU: Production API Management - Local Edition 5.x clusters
        should have a minimum of 6 Processors allocated towards the
        platform's components.

Licensed Software that was generally available ("GA") as of the

5.3.x, or 5.2.x, or 5.1.x, or 5.0.x, or 4.x.x, or 3.x.x., etc.,
or any later released version that is an update of such version
(e.g., if Boomi were to release a version 4.4.4 in the future,
in support of version 4.4.3, the license would not extend to
such a version 4.4.4).
