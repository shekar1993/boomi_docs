You can permanently delete map elements from the flow canvas.

CAUTION:

Deleting a map element from the flow canvas is permanent and cannot be undone. You may wish to remove any outcomes from the map element and move them to an unused area of the canvas instead, until you are sure that you wish to delete the map element.

1.  Select the map element that you wish to delete. See [Selecting map elements on the flow canvas](c-flo-Canvas_Selecting_Elements_3335aefc-541b-43ea-aa63-01cdde316c7b.md).
2.  Click on the **Delete** icon ![Delete element icon](../Images/img-flo-Icon_Delete_Map_element_e2971e36-b7c4-4d99-a212-637b71bce4c0.png) on the map element.
3.  The **Confirm Delete** dialog is displayed. A table shows any connected outcomes that will also be deleted.
4.  Click **Delete** to delete the map element from the canvas. Any connected outcomes displayed in the table are also deleted.
