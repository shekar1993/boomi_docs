From the **Integration Packs** page, you can browse, install or uninstall, and attach or detach integration packs to and from environments.

Integration packs are developed in a primary account and shared with selected account groups. Install integration packs that have been shared with your account by using the Browse Integration Packs dialog.

You can access the Browse Integration Packs dialog from the **Integration Packs** page \(**Deploy** \> **Integration Packs**\).

**Note:** For Legacy deployment, go to the **Deploy** page and select **Integration Packs** from the components list.

After you install an integration pack, you can attach environments to it and then run any of its processes from the **Deployed Processes** tab in Atom Management. You can monitor the release status of installed integration packs and apply pending updates from the**Integration Pack Versions** tab in Atom Management. However, you cannot apply pending updates for integration packs to which an environment is attached unless an Atom is attached to that environment.

Some integration packs are enabled for multiple installations per account. If you install multiple instances of an integration pack, you can use the same processes with different extension values.

:::note

Multi-install integration packs include only processes; they cannot include API Service components.
