**What are the Boomi AI terms and conditions?**

You can review the terms and conditions for Boomi AI in our [Boomi Product Specific Terms](http://boomi.com/pst) document.

**How do you manage the segregation/privacy of the data used to train the model? Could you confirm that the customer specific data is used only to train the customer model?**

Customer-specific data is not used to train the customer model or any other model. We use de-identified metadata for training. Only process constructs are used. The model does not include any configuration data. The logs used for training the model do not contain your underlying processed data.

**How do you manage the segregation/privacy of the prompts? Could you confirm that the prompts generated by the customer are only accessible by the customer?**

Prompts generated by a customer are only accessible by that customer. The NLP layer of the conversational experience is built by Boomi (with privacy by design principles) with a segregation of customer & user prompts. AWS Bedrock holds these prompts, but they are not used to train any shared models. Customer-specific data is not used to train the model. 

**Does Boomi AI use external LLMs or other AI technologies?**

We employ a Composite AI framework that dynamically selects the most suitable AI model for a given use case from a pool of models. These models encompass a range, from Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to those build on AI/ML algorithms such as Neural Networks and K-Means clustering.

We utilize Anthropic Claude via Amazon Bedrock’s managed service for our LLM. All of this operates seamlessly within AWS, sharing the same infrastructure as the main instance of our Boomi Enterprise Platform’s SaaS solution.

## AI Agents

**What are AI agents?**

AI agents are software components that have a defined purpose and personality. They provide automation and perform specific tasks with or without human intervention. They use AI-based reasoning to independently decide how to accomplish a task and take action. Some AI agents can work together to complete complex processes seamlessly.

For example, a travel booking agent could receive a user’s request and independently orchestrate other AI agents in order to book the requested travel experience. Different AI agents work together to obtain information and then take action by reserving a hotel, car rentals, and flights.

**Are Boomi AI Agents free?**

Boomi is currently offering eight Boomi AI Agents for free, which include:

- Boomi GPT (pre-installed)
- Boomi DesignGen (pre-installed)
- Boomi Scribe (pre-installed)
- Boomi Answers (pre-installed)
- Boomi DataDetective (Early Access)
- Boomi Pathfinder (pre-installed)

Read [Boomi AI](/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/atm-About_BoomiAI_d3bd0d92-4185-44a5-925f-0cb392fa1978.md) to learn more about what each Boomi AI agent does.

You can also install User-created AI agents and Partner agents on the Boomi AI start page to use in the Platform.

**How do I get access to Boomi AI Agents?**

- Eight pre-installed Boomi AI Agents listed above are enabled for all Boomi users with an account ID. You do not need to request access.
- Boomi Data Detective is currently in Early Access and you will need to contact Sales to request access.

**Can I get Boomi AI access removed from my account?**

Yes, please contact Sales.

**Are there usage limits on Boomi AI Agents?**

Yes, to ensure optimal service for all users, we have implemented daily AI service request limits for all accounts, which reset at 12:00 AM UTC. As a result, Boomi GPT may display the following error message when the limit is exceeded: `You have reached our daily limit of messages. Please try again later.`

Additionally, usage of some agents will count towards the platform API consumption limits for your account.

**What are User AI agents?**

You can build and install your own AI agents. User AI agents are developed using the Boomi Enterprise Platform, which provides all the necessary building blocks. Boomi’s connectivity and orchestration capabilities enable users to interact with selected models via API, access proprietary data sources, and automate actions through various applications. The Boomi platform’s process canvas allows the creation of sophisticated workflows to retrieve, combine, filter, and contextualize data, facilitating model prompting and techniques like RAG and fine-tuning. Boomi DataHub serves as an access point and repository for the agents’ knowledge base, while Boomi Flow and Boomi API Management offer human or machine interfaces to package these components into standalone AI agents. Read [Build AI agents](https://developer.boomi.com/docs/category/build-ai-agents) to learn more.

**What are Partner AI agents?**

Partner AI agents are pluggable components that allow Boomi Enterprise Platform users to install and use best-of-breed AI functions from Boomi’s network of partners. These agents can be utilized in the same way as Boomi AI Agents, and allow rich capabilities to be incorporated from across the digital ecosystem. An example is the recently announced Boomi FinTalk powered by Vianai agent that allows business users to get detailed responses on financial information via Boomi GPT.

**How do I get access to Partner Agents?**

Please contact Sales. 

**What is the AI Agent Framework?**

The AI Agent Framework is a set of integration and no-code development capabilities that enable business and IT users to run AI agents built by Boomi or Boomi partners, and to build and run their own AI agents to solve pressing integration and automation requirements.

Currently, there are six Boomi AI agents available in the Platform. In the near future, you will be able to view and install User AI agents and Partner agents on the Boomi AI start page to use in the Platform. Read [Boomi AI](/docs/Atomsphere/Platform/atm-About_BoomiAI_d3bd0d92-4185-44a5-925f-0cb392fa1978.md) to learn more.
