The IFS FSM REST operation defines how to interact with your IFS FSM account and represents a specific action to perform against a specific IFS FSM object.

Create a separate operation component for each action/object combination that your integration requires.

The IFS FSM REST operations use JSON format and support the following actions:

-   **Action** — provides the ability to invoke a selected FSM Perform Message.
-   **Create** — creates a new record in IFS FSM.
-   **Delete** — deletes an existing records in IFS FSM.
-   **Get** — retrieves a specific record from IFS FSM based on its primary key.
-   **Query** — retrieves one or more records from IFS FSM, optionally based on a filter.
-   **Update** — updates an existing record in IFS FSM.

## Options tab

Click **Import Operation**, then use the Import wizard to browse the API schema for IFS FSM. If you select an object, the operation loads the relevant Request and/or Response profiles for the API. Clicking on the **Edit** icon for either allows you to view the schema for the profile.

**Option**   
Select Prefer: return=minimal if you do not want the result of the operation returned. Only its status is returned.

**Request/Response Profile**   
The JSON profile definition that represents the structure sent or received by the connector.

<ReturnErrRes />

**Option**   
Select Prefer: return=minimal if you do not want the result of the operation returned. Only its status is returned.

## Action

You can invoke FSM perform messages \(also called MPMs\) using the outbound Action action. The perform name is the object selected in the **Import Wizard**. Any parameters related to the selected perform must be configured and passed using the Parameters tab of the Connector step.

## Create

The outbound Create action creates new records in the IFS FSM system. This action is supported for most object types, including custom types.


:::note

The Create action does not support batching.

:::

## Delete

The outbound Delete action deletes an existing record in the IFS FSM system. The output profile for a delete operation is ignored. Delete does not support batching.


:::note

The service does not support bulk or paged deletions.

:::

## Get

The inbound Get action requires the Record \(type\) and Primary Key for an entity type and unique identifier. The Get action does not support paging or batching.


:::note

Attributes having a null value are not returned, and you should assume that non-returned attributes are null in the system. If you set the attribute to a value, it is returned in all subsequent Get operations to match the profile.

:::

## Query

The inbound Query action retrieves one or more records from IFS. Any attributes having a null value are not returned in a query, and you should assume that non-returned attributes are null in the system. If you set the attribute to a value, it is returned in all subsequent queries to match the profile.

Entities can have attributes or references to other entities. The IFS FSM REST connector enables you to specify an arbitrary logic tree for top-level attributes and reference attributes.

-   You can query by attribute only top-level attributes.
-   You can query by reference for entity references.


:::note

The Query action does not support batching or relationship entities.

:::

## Update

The outbound Update action updates an existing record in IFS FSM. You must include the primary KeyID of the record being updated in the request.

The service does not support batched or paged Update requests.
